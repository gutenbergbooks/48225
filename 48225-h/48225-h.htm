<h2><a name="EDITORS_PREFACE_TO_SECOND" id="EDITORS_PREFACE_TO_SECOND"></a>EDITOR'S PREFACE TO SECOND
EDITION</h2>


<p>The following papers have been gathered together from various sources,
and are now available for the first time to English readers. The subject
of psychoanalysis is much in evidence, and is likely to occupy still
more attention in the near future, as the psychological content of the
psychoses and neuroses is more generally appreciated and understood.
It is of importance, therefore, that the fundamental writings of both
the Viennese and Zürich Schools should be accessible for study. Several
of Freud's works have already been translated into English. Dr. Jung's
"Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido" was published in America in 1916
under the title of "The Psychology of the Unconscious." That work, read
in conjunction with these papers, offers a fairly complete picture of the
scientific and philosophic standpoint of the leader of the Zürich School.
It is the task of the future to judge and expand the findings of both
schools, and to work at the development of the new psychology, which is
still in its infancy.</p>

<p>It will be a relief to many students of the unconscious to see it in
another aspect than that of "a wild beast couched, waiting its hour to
spring." Some readers have gathered that view of it from the writings
of the Viennese School, a view which is at most that dangerous thing "a
half-truth."</p>

<p>In the papers appearing for the first time in this edition (Chapters
XIV. and XV.), Dr. Jung develops his ideas of introversion and
extroversion, a contribution of the first importance to psychology.
He agrees with Freud in regarding the neuroses to be the result of
repression, but differs in his view as to the origin of repression.
He finds this to lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
not in sexuality <em>per se</em>, but rather in man's natural tendency
to adapt to the demands of life one-sidedly, according to his type of
mentality. The born extrovert adapts by means of feeling, thought being
under repression and relatively infantile. The introvert's natural
adaptation is by means of thought; feeling being more or less repressed
remains undeveloped. In either type the neglected co-function is behind
the adapted function. This inequality operating in the unconscious,
brings about a conflict, which in certain subjects amounts to a neurosis,
and in others produces a limitation of individual development. This view
shifts the interpretation of repression on to a much more comprehensive
basis than that of sexuality, although there can scarcely be a repression
that does not include this instinct on account of its deep and
far-reaching importance in man.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that some even scientific persons have a certain
fear of whither the study of the unconscious may lead. These fearful
persons should be reminded that they possess an unconscious in spite of
themselves, and that they share it in common with every human being. It
is an extension of the individual. To study it is to deepen the self.
All new discoveries have at one stage been called dangerous, and all new
philosophies have been deemed heresies. It is as though we would once
more consign radium to its dust-heaps, lest some day the new radiancy
should over-power mankind. Indeed this particular thing has proved
at once most dangerous and most precious. Man must learn to use his
treasure, and in using it to <em>submit to its own laws</em>, which can
only become known when it is handled and investigated.</p>

<p>Those who read this book with the attention it requires, will find
they gain an impression of many new truths. The second edition is issued
towards the end of the third year of the Great European war, at a time
when much we have valued and held sacred is in the melting-pot. But we
believe that out of the crucible new forms will arise. The study of
psychoanalysis produces something of the effect of a war in the psyche;
indeed, we need to make conscious this war in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
inner things of the mind and soul if we would be delivered in the
future from war in the external world. There is a parallelism between
individual and international neurosis. In the pain of the upheaval, one
recognises the birth-pangs of newer, and let us hope, truer thought,
and more natural adaptations. We need a renewal of our philosophy of
life to replace much that has perished in the general cataclysm, and
it is because I see in the analytical psychology, which grows out
of a scientific study of the unconscious, the germs of such a new
construction, that I have gathered the following essays together. The
translation is the work of various hands, the names of the different
translators being given in a footnote at the beginning of each essay; for
the editing I am responsible. The essays are, as far as possible, printed
in chronological order, and those readers who are sufficiently interested
will be able to discern in them the gradual development of Dr. Jung's
present position in psychoanalysis.</p>

<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE_TO_SECOND" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE_TO_SECOND"></a>AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO SECOND
EDITION</h2>


<p>In agreement with my honoured collaborator, Dr. C. E. Long, I have
made certain additions to the second edition. It should especially be
mentioned that a new chapter upon "The Concept of the Unconscious" has
been added. This is a lecture I gave early in 1916 before the Zürich
Union for Analytical Psychology. It gives a general orientation of a
most important problem in practical analysis, viz. of the relation
of the psychological ego to the psychological non-ego. Chapter XIV.
has been fundamentally altered, and I have used the opportunity to
incorporate an article that should describe the results of more recent
researches. In accordance with my usual mode of working, the description
is as generalised as possible. My habit in my daily practical work is
to confine myself for some time to studying my human material. I then
abstract as generalised a formula as possible from the data collected,
obtaining from it a point of view and applying it in my practical work,
until it has either been confirmed, modified, or else abandoned. If it
has been confirmed, I publish it as a general view-point, without giving
the empirical material. I only introduce the material amassed in the
course of my practice in the form of example or illustration. I therefore
beg the reader not to consider the views I present as mere fabrications
of my brain. They are, as a matter of fact, the results of extensive
experience and ripe reflection.</p>

<p>These additions will enable the reader of the second edition to become
familiar with the recent views of the Zürich School.</p>

<p>As regards the criticism encountered by the first edition
of this work, I was pleased to find my writings were received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
with much more open-mindedness among English critics than was the case
in Germany, where they are met with the silence born of contempt. I
am particularly grateful to Dr. Agnes Savill for an exceptionally
understanding criticism in the <cite>Medical Press</cite>. My thanks
are also due to Dr. T. W. Mitchell for an exhaustive review in the
<cite>Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research</cite>. This
critic takes exception to my heresy respecting causality. He considers
that I am entering upon a perilous, because unscientific, course, when
I question the sole validity of the causal view-point in psychology.
I sympathise with him, but in my opinion the nature of the human mind
compels us to take the final point of view. For it cannot be disputed
that, psychologically speaking, we are living and working, day by day,
according to the principle of directed aim or purpose, as well as that
of causality. A psychological theory must necessarily adapt itself to
this fact. What is plainly directed towards a goal cannot be given
an exclusively causalistic explanation, otherwise we should be led
to the conclusion expressed in Moleschott's famous enunciation: "Man
<em>is</em>, what he eats." We must always bear the fact in mind that
<em>causality is a point of view</em>. It affirms the inevitable and
immutable relation of a series of events: a-b-d-z. Since this relation
is fixed, and according to the view-point must necessarily be so, looked
at logically the order may also be reversed. <em>Finality is also a
view-point</em>, that is justified empirically solely by the existence
of series of events, wherein the causal connection is indeed evident,
<em>but the meaning of which only becomes intelligible as producing final
effect</em>. Ordinary daily life furnishes the best instances of this.
The causal explanation must be mechanistic, if we are not to postulate
a metaphysical entity as first cause. For instance, if we adopt Freud's
sexual theory and assign primary importance psychologically to the
function of the genital glands, the brain is viewed as an appendage of
the genital glands. If we approach the Viennese idea of sexuality with
all its vague omnipotence, and trace it in a strictly scientific manner
down to its psychological basis, we shall arrive at the first cause,
according to which psychic life is for the most, or the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
important part, tension and relaxation of the genital glands. If we
assume for the moment that this mechanistic explanation be "true," it
would be the sort of truth which is exceptionally tiresome and rigidly
limited in scope. A similar statement would be that the genital glands
cannot function without adequate <em>nourishment</em>, with its inference
that sexuality is an appendage-function of nutrition! The truth contained
in this is really an important chapter in the biology of lower forms of
life.</p>

<p>But if we wish to work in a really psychological way, we shall want to
know the <em>meaning</em> of psychological phenomena. After learning the
kinds of steel the various parts of a locomotive are made of, and from
what ironworks and mines they come, we do not really know anything about
the locomotive's <em>function</em>, that is to say, its <em>meaning</em>.
But "function" as conceived by modern science is by no means solely a
causal concept; it is especially a final or "teleological" one. For it
is utterly impossible to consider the soul from the causal view-point
only; we are obliged to consider it also from the final point of view.
As Dr. Mitchell also points out, it is impossible for us to think of
the causal determination conjointly with a final connection. That would
be an obvious contradiction. But our theory of cognition does not need
to remain on a pre-Kantian level. It is well known that Kant showed
very clearly that the mechanistic and the teleological view-points
are not <em>constituent</em> (objective) principles, in some degree
qualities of the object, but that they are purely <em>regulative</em>
(subjective) principles of thought, and as such they are not mutually
inconsistent. I can, for example, easily conceive the following thesis
and antithesis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Thesis</em>: Everything came into existence according to
mechanistic laws.</p>

<p><em>Antithesis</em>: Some things did not come into existence according
to mechanistic laws only.</p></blockquote>

<p>Kant says to this: Reason cannot prove either of these principles,
because <em>a priori</em> purely empirical laws of nature cannot give us
a determinative principle regarding the potentiality of things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, modern physics has necessarily been converted
from the idea of pure mechanism to the final concept of the conservation
of energy, because the mechanistic explanation only recognises reversible
processes, whereas the actual truth is that the process of nature is
irreversible. This fact led to the concept of an energy that tends
towards relief of tension, and therewith also towards a definite final
state.</p>

<p>Obviously, I consider both these points of view necessary, the causal
as well as the final, but would at the same time lay stress upon the fact
that since Kant's time we have come to know that the two view-points
are not antagonistic if they are regarded as regulative principles of
thought, and not as constituent principles of the process of nature
itself.</p>

<p>When speaking of the reviews, I must also mention those that seem
to me beside the mark. I was once more struck by the fact that certain
critics cannot distinguish between the theoretical explanation given by
the author, and the phantastic ideas provided by the patient. One of
my critics makes this confusion when discussing "Number Dreams." The
associations to the quotation from the Bible in Chapter V. are, as every
attentive reader must readily perceive, not arbitrary explanations of my
own, but a cryptomnesic conglomeration emanating, not from my brain at
all, but from that of the patient. Surely it is not difficult to perceive
upon reflection that this conglomeration of numbers corresponds exactly
to that unconscious psychological function from which proceeded all the
mysticism of numbers, Pythagoric, Kabbalistic, and so forth, existent
from untold ages.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my serious reviewers, and should like here to also
express my thanks to Mrs. Harold F. McCormick for her generous help in
the production of this book.</p>

<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE_TO_FIRST" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE_TO_FIRST"></a>AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO FIRST
EDITION</h2>


<p>This volume contains a selection of articles and pamphlets on
analytical psychology written at intervals during the past fourteen
years. These years have seen the development of a new discipline, and as
is usual in such a case, have involved many changes of view-point, of
concept, and of formulation.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to give a presentation of the fundamental
concepts of analytical psychology in this book; it throws some
light, however, on a certain line of development which is especially
characteristic of the Zürich School of psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>As is well known, the merit of the discovery of the new analytical
method of general psychology belongs to Professor Freud of Vienna. His
original view-points had to undergo many essential modifications, some
of them owing to the work done at Zürich, in spite of the fact that he
himself is far from agreeing with the standpoint of this school.</p>

<p>I am unable to explain fully the fundamental differences between the
two schools, but would indicate the following points: The Vienna School
takes the standpoint of an exclusive sexualistic conception, while
that of the Zürich School is symbolistic. The Vienna School interprets
the psychological symbol semiotically, as a sign or token of certain
primitive psychosexual processes. Its method is analytical and causal.</p>

<p>The Zürich School recognises the scientific feasibility of such a
conception, but denies its exclusive validity, for it does not interpret
the psychological symbol semiotically only, but also symbolistically,
that is, it attributes a positive value to the symbol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>The value does not depend merely on historical causes; its chief
importance lies in the fact that it has a meaning for the actual present,
and for the future, in their psychological aspects. For to the Zürich
School the symbol is not merely a sign of something repressed and
concealed, but is at the same time an attempt to comprehend and to point
out the way of the further psychological development of the individual.
Thus we add a prospective import to the retrospective value of the
symbol.</p>

<p>The method of the Zürich School is therefore not only analytical and
causal, but also synthetic and prospective, in recognition that the
human mind is characterised by "causæ" and also by "fines" (aims). The
latter fact needs particular emphasis, because there are two types of
psychology, the one following the principle of hedonism, and the other
following the principle of power. Scientific materialism is pertinent
to the former type, and the philosophy of Nietzsche to the latter. The
principle of the Freudian theory is hedonism, while that of Adler (one
of Freud's earliest personal pupils) is founded upon the principle of
power.</p>

<p>The Zürich School, recognising the existence of these two types (also
remarked by the late Professor William James), considers that the views
of Freud and Adler are one-sided, and only valid within the limits of
their corresponding type. Both principles exist within every individual,
but not in equal proportions.</p>

<p>Thus, it is obvious that each psychological symbol has two aspects,
and should be interpreted according to the two principles. Freud and
Adler interpret in the analytical and causal way, reducing to the
infantile and primitive. Thus with Freud the conception of the "aim" is
the fulfilment of desire, with Adler it is the usurpation of power. Both
authors take the standpoint in their practical analytical work which
brings to view only infantile and gross egoistic aims.</p>

<p>The Zürich School is convinced of the fact that within the limits of
a diseased mental attitude the psychology is such as Freud and Adler
describe. It is, indeed, just on account of
such impossible and childish psychology that the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
is in a state of inward dissociation and hence neurotic. The
Zürich School, therefore, in agreement with them so far, also
reduces the psychological symbol (the phantasy products of
the patient) to the fundamental infantile hedonism, or to the
infantile desire for power. But Freud and Adler content
themselves with the result of mere reduction, according to
their scientific biologism and naturalism.</p>

<p>But here a very important question arises. Can man obey the
fundamental and primitive impulses of his nature without gravely
injuring himself or his fellow beings? He cannot assert either his
sexual desire or his desire for power unlimitedly, and the limits are
moreover very restricted. The Zürich School has in view also the final
result of analysis, and regards the fundamental thoughts and impulses
of the unconscious, as symbols, indicative of a definite line of
future development. We must admit there is, however, <em>no scientific
justification</em> for such a procedure, because our present-day science
is based as a whole upon causality. But causality is only one principle,
and psychology essentially cannot be exhausted by causal methods
only, because the mind lives by aims as well. Besides this disputable
philosophical argument, we have another of much greater value in favour
of our hypothesis, namely, that of <em>vital necessity</em>. It is
impossible to live according to the intimations of infantile hedonism,
or according to a childish desire for power. If these are to be retained
they must be taken symbolically. Out of the symbolic application of
infantile trends, an attitude evolves which may be termed philosophic or
religious, and these terms characterise sufficiently the lines of further
development of the individual. The individual is not only an established
and unchangeable complex of psychological facts, but also an extremely
changeable entity. By exclusive reduction to causes, the primitive
trends of a personality are reinforced; this is only helpful when at
the same time these primitive tendencies are balanced by recognition
of their symbolic value. Analysis and reduction lead to causal truth;
this by itself does not help living, but brings about resignation and
hopelessness. On the other hand, the recognition of the intrinsic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
value of a symbol leads to constructive truth and helps us to live.
It induces hopefulness and furthers the possibility of future
development.</p>

<p>The functional importance of the symbol is clearly shown in the
history of civilisation. For thousands of years the religious symbol
proved a most efficacious means in the moral education of mankind. Only a
prejudiced mind could deny such an obvious fact. Concrete values cannot
take the place of the symbol; only new and more efficient symbols can
be substituted for those that are antiquated and outworn, such as have
lost their efficacy through the progress of intellectual analysis and
understanding. The further development of mankind can only be brought
about by means of symbols which represent something far in advance of
himself, and whose intellectual meanings cannot yet be grasped entirely.
The individual unconscious produces such symbols, and they are of the
greatest possible value in the moral development of the personality.</p>

<p>Man almost invariably has philosophic and religious views of the
meaning of the world and of his own life. There are some who are proud to
have none. These are exceptions outside the common path of mankind; they
miss an important function which has proved itself to be indispensable to
the human mind.</p>

<p>In such cases we find in the unconscious, instead of modern symbolism,

<p class="p3">ON THE PSYCHOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OF
SO-CALLED OCCULT PHENOMENA<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>


<p>In that wide field of psychopathic deficiency where Science
has demarcated the diseases of epilepsy, hysteria and neurasthenia,
we meet scattered observations concerning certain
rare states of consciousness as to whose meaning authors
are not yet agreed. These observations spring up sporadically
in the literature on narcolepsy, lethargy, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">automatisme
ambulatoire</i>, periodic amnesia, double consciousness, somnambulism,
pathological dreamy states, pathological lying, etc.</p>

<p>These states are sometimes attributed to epilepsy, sometimes
to hysteria, sometimes to exhaustion of the nervous
system, or neurasthenia, sometimes they are allowed all
the dignity of a disease <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sui generis</i>. Patients occasionally
work through a whole graduated scale of diagnoses, from
epilepsy, through hysteria, up to simulation. In practice,
on the one hand, these conditions can only be separated with
great difficulty from the so-called neuroses, sometimes even
are indistinguishable from them; on the other, certain
features in the region of pathological deficiency present more
than a mere analogical relationship not only with phenomena
of normal psychology, but also with the psychology of the
supernormal, of genius. Various as are the individual
phenomena in this region, there is certainly no case that
cannot be connected by some intermediate example with the
other typical cases. This relationship in the pictures presented
by hysteria and epilepsy is very close. Recently the
view has even been maintained that there is no clean-cut
frontier between epilepsy and hysteria, and that a difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
is only to be noted in extreme cases. Steffens says, for
example<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;"We are forced to the conclusion that in essence
hysteria and epilepsy are not fundamentally different, that
the cause of the disease is the same, but is manifest in a
diverse form, in different intensity and permanence."</p>

<p>The demarcation of hysteria and certain borderline cases
of epilepsy from congenital and acquired psychopathic
mental deficiency likewise presents the greatest difficulties.
The symptoms of one or other disease everywhere invade the
neighbouring realm, so violence is done to the facts when
they are split off and considered as belonging to one or other
realm. The demarcation of psychopathic mental deficiency
from the normal is an absolutely impossible task, the
difference is everywhere only "more or less." The classification
in the region of mental deficiency itself is confronted
by the same difficulty. At best, certain classes can be
separated off which crystallise round some well-marked
nucleus through having peculiarly typical features. Turning
away from the two large groups of intellectual and
emotional deficiency, there remain those deficiencies coloured
pre-eminently by hysteria or epilepsy (epileptoid) or neurasthenia,
which are not notably deficiency of the intellect or
of feeling. It is essentially in this region, insusceptible of
any absolute classification, that the above-named conditions
play their part. As is well known, they can appear as part
manifestations of a typical epilepsy or hysteria, or can exist
separately in the realm of psychopathic mental deficiency,
where their qualifications of epileptic or hysterical are often
due to the non-essential accessory features. It is thus the
rule to place somnambulism among hysterical diseases,
because it is occasionally a phenomenon of severe hysteria,
or because mild so-called hysterical symptoms may accompany
it. Binet says: "Il n'y a pas une somnambulisme,
état nerveux toujours identique à lui-même, il y a des somnambulismes."
As one of the manifestations of a severe
hysteria, somnambulism is not an unknown phenomenon,
but as a pathological entity, as a disease <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sui generis</i>, it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
be somewhat rare, to judge by its infrequency in German
literature on the subject. So-called spontaneous somnambulism,
resting upon a foundation of hysterically-tinged
psychopathic deficiency, is not a very common occurrence
and it is worth while to devote closer study to these cases,
for they occasionally present a mass of interesting particulars.</p>

<p><cite>Case of Miss Elise K.</cite>, aged 40, single; book-keeper in a
large business; no hereditary taint, except that it is alleged
a brother became slightly nervous after family misfortune
and illness. Well educated, of a cheerful, joyous nature,
not of a saving disposition, always occupied with some
big idea. She was very kind-hearted and gentle, did a
great deal both for her parents, who were living in very
modest circumstances, and for strangers. Nevertheless she
was not happy, because she thought she did not understand
herself. She had always enjoyed good health till a
few years ago, when she is said to have been treated for dilatation
of the stomach and tapeworm. During this illness
her hair became rapidly white, later she had typhoid fever.
An engagement was terminated by the death of her fiancé
from paralysis. She had been very nervous for a year and
a half. In the summer of 1897 she went away for change of
air and treatment by hydropathy. She herself says that for
about a year she has had moments during work when her
thoughts seem to stand still, but she does not fall asleep.
Nevertheless she makes no mistakes in the accounts at such
times. She has often been to the wrong street and then
suddenly noticed that she was not in the right place. She
has had no giddiness or attacks of fainting. Formerly menstruation
occurred regularly every four weeks, and without any
pain, but since she has been nervous and overworked it has
come every fourteen days. For a long time she has suffered
from constant headache. As accountant and book-keeper in a
large establishment, the patient has had very strenuous work,
which she performs well and conscientiously. In addition
to the strenuous character of her work, in the last year she
had various new worries. Her brother was suddenly divorced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
In addition to her own work, she looked after his housekeeping,
nursed him and his child in a serious illness, and so on.
To recuperate, she took a journey on the 13th September to see
a woman friend in South Germany. The great joy at seeing
her friend from whom she had been long separated, and her
participation in some festivities, deprived her of her rest.
On the 15th, she and her friend drank half a bottle of claret.
This was contrary to her usual habit. They then went for
a walk in a cemetery, where she began to tear up flowers
and to scratch at the graves. She remembered absolutely
nothing of this afterwards. On the 16th she remained with
her friend without anything of importance happening. On
the 17th her friend brought her to Zürich. An acquaintance
came with her to the Asylum; on the way she spoke quite
sensibly, but was very tired. Outside the Asylum they met
three boys, whom she described as the "three dead people
she had dug up." She then wanted to go to the neighbouring
cemetery, but was persuaded to come to the Asylum.</p>

<p>She is small, delicately formed, slightly anæmic. The
heart is slightly enlarged to the left, there are no murmurs,
but some reduplication of the sounds, the mitral being
markedly accentuated. The liver dulness reaches to the
border of the ribs. Patella-reflex is somewhat increased,
but otherwise no tendon-reflexes. There is neither anæsthesia,
analgesia, nor paralysis. Rough examination of the
field of vision with the hands shows no contraction. The
patient's hair is a very light yellow-white colour; on the
whole she looks her age. She gives her history and tells
recent events quite clearly, but has no recollection of what
took place in the cemetery at C. or outside the Asylum.
During the night of the 17th-18th she spoke to the attendant
and declared she saw the whole room full of dead people&mdash;looking
like skeletons. She was not at all frightened, but
was rather surprised that the attendant did not see them
too. Once she ran to the window, but was otherwise quiet.
The next morning, while still in bed, she saw skeletons, but
not in the afternoon. The following night at four o'clock
she awoke and heard the dead children in the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
cemetery cry out that they had been buried alive. She
wanted to go out to dig them up, but allowed herself to be restrained.
Next morning at seven o'clock she was still delirious,
but recalled accurately the events in the cemetery at C. and
those on approaching the Asylum. She stated that at C.
she wanted to dig up the dead children who were calling her.
She had only torn up the flowers to free the graves and to be
able to get at them. In this state Professor Bleuler explained
to her that later on, when in a normal state again, she would
remember everything. The patient slept in the morning,
afterwards was quite clear, and felt herself relatively well.
She did indeed remember the attacks, but maintained a
remarkable indifference towards them. The following nights,
with the exception of those of the 22nd and the 25th
September, she again had slight attacks of delirium, when
once more she had to deal with the dead. The details of
the attacks differed, however. Twice she saw the dead in
her bed, but she did not appear to be afraid of them, she got
out of bed frequently, however, because she did not want
"to inconvenience the dead"; several times she wanted to
leave the room.</p>

<p>After a few nights free from attacks there was a slight
one on the 30th Sept., when she called the dead from the
window. During the day her mind was clear. On the 3rd of
October she saw a whole crowd of skeletons in the drawingroom,
as she afterwards related, during full consciousness.
Although she doubted the reality of the skeletons, she could
not convince herself that it was a hallucination. The following
night, between twelve and one o'clock&mdash;the earlier attacks
were usually about this time&mdash;she was obsessed with the idea
of dead people for about ten minutes. She sat up in bed,
stared at a corner and said: "Well, come!&mdash;but they're not
all there. Come along! Why don't you come? The room
is big enough, there's room for all; when all are there, I'll
come too." Then she lay down with the words: "Now
they're all there," and fell asleep again. In the morning
she had not the slightest recollection of any of these attacks.
Very short attacks occurred in the nights of the 4th, 6th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
9th, 13th and 15th of October, between twelve and one
o'clock. The last three occurred during the menstrual period.
The attendant spoke to her several times, showed her the
lighted street-lamps, and trees; but she did not react to
this conversation. Since then the attacks have altogether
ceased. The patient has complained about a number of
troubles which she had had all along. She suffered much
from headache the morning after the attacks. She said
it was unbearable. Five grains of Sacch. lactis promptly
alleviated this; then she complained of pains in both fore-arms,
which she described as if it were a teno-synovitis. She
regarded the bulging of the muscles in flexion as a swelling,
and asked to be massaged. Nothing could be seen objectively,
and no attention being paid to it, the trouble disappeared.
She complained exceedingly and for a long time
about the thickening of a toenail, even after the thickened
part had been removed. Sleep was often disturbed. She
would not give her consent to be hypnotised for the night-attacks.
Finally on account of headache and disturbed sleep
she agreed to hypnotic treatment. She proved a good subject,
and at the first sitting fell into deep sleep with analgesia and
amnesia.</p>

<p>In November she was again asked whether she could now
remember the attack on the 19th September which it had been
suggested that she would recall. It gave her great trouble
to recollect it, and in the end she could only state the chief
facts, she had forgotten the details.</p>

<p>It should be added that the patient was not superstitious,
and in her healthy days had never particularly interested
herself in the supernatural. During the whole course of
treatment, which ended on the 14th November, great indifference
was evinced both to the illness and the cure. Next
spring the patient returned for out-patient treatment of the
headache, which had come back during the very hard work of
these months. Apart from this symptom her condition left
nothing to be desired. It was demonstrated that she had
no remembrance of the attacks of the previous autumn, not
even of those of the 19th September and earlier. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
other hand, in hypnosis she could recount the proceedings in
the cemetery and during the nightly disturbances.</p>

<p>By the peculiar hallucination and by its appearance our
case recalls the conditions which V. Kraft-Ebing has described
as "protracted states of hysterical delirium." He
says: "Such conditions of delirium occur in the slighter
cases of hysteria. Protracted hysterical delirium is built
upon a foundation of temporary exhaustion. Excitement
seems to determine an outbreak, and it readily recurs. Most
frequently there is persecution-delirium with very violent
anxiety, sometimes of a religious or erotic character. Hallucinations
of all the senses are not rare, but illusions of sight,
smell and feeling are the commonest, and most important.
The visual hallucinations are especially visions of animals,
pictures of corpses, phantastic processions in which dead
persons, devils and ghosts swarm. The illusions of hearing
are simply sounds (shrieks, howlings, claps of thunder) or
local hallucinations, frequently with a sexual content."</p>

<p>This patient's visions of corpses, occurring almost always
in attacks, recall the states occasionally seen in hystero-epilepsy.
There likewise occur specific visions which, in contrast
with protracted delirium, are connected with single
attacks.</p>

<p>(1) A lady 30 years of age with <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">grande hystérie</i> had
twilight states in which as a rule she was troubled by terrible
hallucinations; she saw her children carried away from her,
wild beasts eating them up, and so on. She has amnesia for
the content of the individual attacks.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>(2) A girl of 17, likewise a semi-hysteric, saw in her
attacks the corpse of her dead mother approaching her to
draw her to her. Patient has amnesia for the attacks.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>These are cases of severe hysteria wherein consciousness
rests upon a profound stage of dreaming. The nature of the
attack and the stability of the hallucination alone show a
certain kinship with our case, which in this respect has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>numerous analogies with the corresponding states of hysteria.
For instance, with those cases where a psychical shock
(rape, etc.) was the occasion for the outbreak of hysterical
attacks, and where at times the original incident is lived over
again, stereotyped in the hallucination. But our case gets
its specific mould from the identity of the consciousness in
the different attacks. It is an "Etat Second" with its own
memory and separated from the waking state by complete
amnesia. This differentiates it from the above-mentioned
twilight states and links it to the so-called somnambulic
conditions.</p>

<p>Charcot<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> divides the somnambulic states into two chief
classes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Delirium with well-marked incoordination of representation
and action.</p>

<p>2. Delirium with co-ordinated action. This approaches
the waking state.</p>

<p>Our case belongs to the latter class.</p>

<p>If by somnambulism be understood a state of systematised
partial waking,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> any critical review of this affection must
take account of those exceptional cases of recurrent amnesias
which have been observed now and again. These, apart from
nocturnal ambulism, are the simplest conditions of systematised
partial waking. Naef's case is certainly the most
remarkable in the literature. It deals with a gentleman of
32, with a very bad family history presenting numerous signs
of degeneration, partly functional, partly organic. In consequence
of over-work at the age of 17 he had a peculiar
twilight state with delusions, which lasted some days and was
cured with a sudden recovery of memory. Later he was subject
to frequent attacks of giddiness and palpitation of the heart
and vomiting; but these attacks were never attended by loss
of consciousness. At the termination of some feverish illness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>he suddenly travelled from Australia to Zürich, where he
lived for some weeks in careless cheerfulness, and only came
to himself when he read in the paper of his sudden disappearance
from Australia. He had a total and retrograde
amnesia for the several months which included the journey
to Australia, his sojourn there and the return journey.</p>

<p>Azam<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> has published a case of periodic amnesia. Albert
X., 12-1/2 years old, of hysterical disposition, was several
times attacked in the course of a few years by conditions of
amnesia in which he forgot reading, writing and arithmetic,
even at times his own language, for several weeks at a stretch.
The intervals were normal.</p>

<p>Proust<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> has published a case of <em>Automatisme ambulatoire</em>
with pronounced hysteria which differs from Naef's in the
repeated occurrence of the attacks. An educated man, 30
years old, exhibits all the signs of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">grande hystérie;</i> he is
very suggestible, has from time to time, under the influence
of excitement, attacks of amnesia which last from two days
to several weeks. During these states he wanders about,
visits relatives, destroys various objects, incurs debts, and
has even been convicted of "picking pockets."</p>

<p>Boileau describes a similar case<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of wandering-impulse.
A widow of 22, highly hysterical, became terrified at the
prospect of a necessary operation for salpingitis; she left the
hospital and fell into a state of somnambulism, from which
she awoke three days later with total amnesia. During these
three days she had travelled a distance of about 60 kilometres
to fetch her child.</p>

<p>William James has described a case of an "ambulatory
sort."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Ansel Bourne, an itinerant preacher, 30 years
of age, psychopathic, had on a few occasions attacks of loss
of consciousness lasting one hour. One day (January 17,
1887) he suddenly disappeared from Greene, after having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>taken 551 dollars out of the bank. He remained hidden for
two months. During this time he had taken a little shop under
the name of H. J. Browne in Norriston, Pa., and had carefully
attended to all purchases, although he had never done this sort
of work before. On March 14, 1887, he suddenly awoke and
went back home, and had complete amnesia for the interval.</p>

<p>Mesnet<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> publishes the following case:&mdash;</p>

<p>F., 27 years old, sergeant in the African regiment, was
wounded in the parietal bone at Bazeilles. Suffered for a
year from hemiplegia, which disappeared when the wound
healed. During the course of his illness the patient had
attacks of somnambulism, with marked limitation of consciousness;
all the senses were paralysed, with the exception
of taste and a small portion of the visual sense. The movements
were co-ordinated, but obstacles in the way of their performance
were overcome with difficulty. During the attacks
he had an absurd collecting-mania. By various manipulations
one could demonstrate a hallucinatory content in his
consciousness; for instance, when a stick was put in his hand
he would feel himself transported to a battle scene, would
place himself on guard, see the enemy approaching, etc.</p>

<p>Guinon and Sophie Waltke<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> made the following experiments
on hysterics:&mdash;</p>

<p>A blue glass was held in front of the eyes of a female
patient during a hysterical attack; she regularly saw the
picture of her mother in the blue sky. A red glass showed
her a bleeding wound, a yellow one an orange-seller or a lady
with a yellow dress.</p>

<p>Mesnet's case reminds one of the cases of occasional
attacks of shrinkage of memory.</p>

<p>MacNish<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> communicates a similar case.</p>

<p>An apparently healthy young lady suddenly fell into an
abnormally long and deep sleep&mdash;it is said without prodromal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>symptoms. On awaking she had forgotten the words for and
the knowledge of the simplest things. She had again to
learn to read, write, and count; her progress was rapid in
this re-learning. After a second attack she again woke in
her normal state, but without recollection of the period when
she had forgotten things. These states alternated for more
than four years, during which consciousness showed continuity
within the two states, but was separated by an amnesia from
the consciousness of the normal state.</p>

<p>These selected cases of various forms of changes of consciousness
all throw a certain light upon our case. Naef's
case presents two hysteriform eclipses of memory, one of
which is marked by the appearance of delusions, and the
other by its long duration, contraction of the field of consciousness,
and desire to wander. The peculiar associated impulses
are specially clear in the cases of Proust and Mesnet. In
our case the impulsive tearing up of the flowers, the digging
up of the graves, form a parallel. The continuity of consciousness
which the patient presents in the individual attacks
recalls the behaviour of the consciousness in MacNish's case;
hence our case may be regarded as a transient phenomenon
of alternating consciousness. The dreamlike hallucinatory
content of the limited consciousness in our case does not,
however, justify an unqualified assignment to this group of
<em>double consciousness</em>. The hallucinations in the second state
show a certain creativeness which seems to be conditioned
by the auto-suggestibility of this state. In Mesnet's case
we noticed the appearance of hallucinatory processes from
simple stimulation of touch. The patient's subconsciousness
employs simple perceptions for the automatic construction
of complicated scenes which then take possession of the
limited consciousness. A somewhat similar view must be
taken about our patient's hallucinations; at least, the external
conditions which gave rise to the appearance of the
hallucinations seem to strengthen our supposition. The walk
in the cemetery induces the vision of the skeletons; the meeting
with the three boys arouses the hallucination of children
buried alive whose voices the patient hears at night-time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
She arrived at the cemetery in a somnambulic state, which
on this occasion was specially intense in consequence of
her having taken alcohol. She performed actions almost
instinctively about which her subconsciousness nevertheless
did receive certain impressions. (The part played here by
alcohol must not be underestimated. We know from experience
that it does not only act adversely upon these conditions,
but, like every other narcotic, it gives rise to a certain
increase of suggestibility.) The impressions received in
somnambulism subconsciously form independent growths,
and finally reach perception as hallucinations. Thus our
case closely corresponds to those somnambulic dream-states
which have recently been subjected to a penetrating study
in England and France.</p>

<p>These lapses of memory, which at first seem without
content, gain a content by means of accidental auto-suggestion,
and this content builds itself up automatically to a
certain extent. It achieves no further development, probably
on account of the improvement now beginning, and finally
it disappears altogether as recovery sets in. Binet and Féré
have made numerous experiments on the implanting of suggestions
in states of partial sleep. They have shown, for
example, that when a pencil is put in the anæsthetic hand
of a hysteric, letters of great length are written automatically
whose contents are unknown to the patient's consciousness.
Cutaneous stimuli in anæsthetic regions are sometimes
perceived as visual images, or at least as vivid associated
visual presentations. These independent transmutations of
simple stimuli must be regarded as primary phenomena in
the formation of somnambulic dream-pictures. Analogous
manifestations occur in exceptional cases within the sphere
of waking consciousness. Goethe,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> for instance, states that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
when he sat down, lowered his head and vividly conjured up
the image of a flower, he saw it undergoing changes of its
own accord, as if entering into new combinations.</p>

<p>In half-waking states these manifestations are relatively frequent in
the so-called hypnagogic hallucinations. The automatisms which the
Goethe example illustrates are differentiated from the truly
somnambulic, inasmuch as the primary presentation is a conscious one in
this case; the further development of the automatism is maintained
within the definite limits of the original presentation, that is, within
the purely motor or visual region.</p>

<p>If the primary presentation disappears, or if it is never
conscious at all, and if the automatic development overlaps
neighbouring regions, we lose every possibility of a demarcation
between waking automatisms and those of the somnambulic
state; this will occur, for instance, if the presentation
of a hand plucking the flower gets joined to the perception of
the flower or the presentation of the smell of the flower. We
can then only differentiate it by the more or less. In one
case we then speak of the "waking hallucinations of the
normal," in the other, of the dream-vision of the somnambulists.
The interpretation of our patient's attacks as
hysterical becomes more certain by the demonstration of a
probably psychogenic origin of the hallucination. This is
confirmed by her troubles, headache and teno-synovitis, which
have shown themselves amenable to suggestive treatment.
The ætiological factor alone is not sufficient for the diagnosis
of hysteria; it might really be expected <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> that in
the course of a disease which is so suitably treated by rest,
as in the treatment of an exhaustion-state, features would
be observed here and there which could be interpreted as
manifestations of exhaustion. The question arises whether
the early lapses and later somnambulic attacks could not be
conceived as states of exhaustion, so-called "neurasthenic
crises." We know that in the realm of psychopathic mental
deficiency there can arise the most diverse epileptoid accidents,
whose classification under epilepsy or hysteria is at
least doubtful. To quote C. Westphal: "On the basis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
numerous observations, I maintain that the so-called epileptoid
attacks form one of the most universal and commonest
symptoms in the group of diseases which we reckon among
the mental diseases and neuropathies; the mere appearance
of one or more epileptic or epileptoid attacks is not decisive
for its course and prognosis. As mentioned, I have used the
concept of epileptoid in the widest sense for the attack itself."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The epileptoid moments of our case are not far to seek;
the objection can, however, be raised that the colouring of the
whole picture is hysterical in the extreme. Against this,
however, it must be stated that every somnambulism is not
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">eo ipso</i> hysterical. Occasionally states occur in typical
epilepsy which to experts seem parallel with somnambulic
states,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> or which can only be distinguished by the existence
of genuine convulsions.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>As Diehl shows,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in neurasthenic mental deficiency crises
also occur which often confuse the diagnosis. A definite
presentation-content can even create a stereotyped repetition
in the individual crisis. Lately Mörchen has published a
case of epileptoid neurasthenic twilight state.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>I am indebted to Professor Bleuler for the report of the
following case:&mdash;</p>

<p>An educated gentleman of middle age&mdash;without epileptic
antecedents&mdash;had exhausted himself by many years of over-strenuous
mental work. Without other prodromal symptoms
(such as depression, etc.) he attempted suicide during a
holiday; in a peculiar twilight state he suddenly threw himself
into the water from a bank, in sight of many persons.
He was at once pulled out and retained but a fleeting remembrance
of the occurrence.</p>

<p>Bearing these observations in mind, neurasthenia must
be allowed to account for a considerable share in the attacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of our patient, Miss E. K. The headaches and the teno-synovitis
point to the existence of a relatively mild hysteria,
generally latent, but becoming manifest under the influence
of exhaustion. The genesis of this peculiar illness explains
the relationship which has been described between epilepsy,
hysteria and neurasthenia.</p>

<p><em>Summary.</em>&mdash;Miss Elise K. is a psychopathic defective
with a tendency to hysteria. Under the influence of nervous
exhaustion she suffers from attacks of epileptoid giddiness
whose interpretation is uncertain at first sight. Under the
influence of an unusually large dose of alcohol the attacks
develop into definite somnambulism with hallucinations,
which are limited in the same way as dreams to accidental
external perceptions. When the nervous exhaustion is cured
the hysterical manifestations disappear.</p>

<p>In the region of psychopathic deficiency with hysterical
colouring, we encounter numerous phenomena which show,
as in this case, symptoms of diverse defined diseases, which
cannot be attributed with certainty to any one of them.
These phenomena are partially recognised to be independent;
for instance, pathological lying, pathological reveries, etc.
Many of these states, however, still await thorough scientific
investigation; at present they belong more or less to the
domain of scientific gossip. Persons with habitual hallucinations,
and also the inspired, exhibit these states; they draw
the attention of the crowd to themselves, now as poet or artist,
now as saviour, prophet or founder of a new sect.</p>

<p>The genesis of the peculiar frame of mind of these persons
is for the most part lost in obscurity, for it is only very
rarely that one of these remarkable personalities can be
subjected to exact observation. In view of the often great
historical importance of these persons, it is much to be wished
that we had some scientific material which would enable us
to gain a closer insight into the psychological development of
their peculiarities. Apart from the now practically useless
productions of the pneumatological school at the beginning
of the nineteenth century, German scientific literature is
very poor in this respect; indeed, there seems to be real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
aversion from investigation in this field. For the facts so far
gathered we are indebted almost exclusively to the labours of
French and English workers. It seems at least desirable
that our literature should be enlarged in this respect. These
considerations have induced me to publish some observations
which will perhaps help to further our knowledge concerning
the relationship of hysterical twilight-states and enlarge the
problems of normal psychology.</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Case of Somnambulism in a Person with Neuropathic
Inheritance (Spiritualistic Medium).</span></p>

<p>The following case was under my observation in the years
1899 and 1900. As I was not in medical attendance upon
Miss S. W., a physical examination for hysterical stigmata
unfortunately could not be made. I kept a complete diary of
the séances, which I filled up after each sitting. The following
report is a condensed account from these notes. Out of
regard for Miss S. W. and her family a few unimportant dates
have been altered and a few details omitted from the story,
which for the most part is composed of very intimate matters.</p>

<p>Miss S. W., 15&frac12; years old. Reformed Church. The
paternal grandfather was highly intelligent, a clergyman
with frequent waking hallucinations (generally visions, often
whole dramatic scenes with dialogues, etc.). A brother of
the grandfather was an imbecile eccentric, who also saw
visions. A sister of the grandfather, a peculiar, odd character.
The paternal grandmother after some fever in her
20th year (typhoid?) had a trance which lasted three days,
from which she did not awake until the crown of her head
had been burned by a red-hot iron. During states of excitement
later on she had fainting fits which were nearly always
followed by a brief somnambulism during which she uttered
prophesies. Her father was likewise a peculiar, original
personality with bizarre ideas. All three had waking hallucinations
(second-sight, forebodings, etc.). A third brother
was also eccentric and odd, talented but one-sided. The
mother has an inherited mental defect often bordering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
on psychosis. The sister is a hysteric and visionary and a
second sister suffers from "nervous heart attacks." Miss
S. W. is slenderly built, skull somewhat rachitic, without pronounced
hydrocephalus, face rather pale, eyes dark with a
peculiar penetrating look. She has had no serious illnesses.
At school she passed for average, showed little interest, was
inattentive. As a rule her behaviour was rather reserved,
sometimes giving place, however, to exuberant joy and exaltation.
Of average intelligence, without special gifts,
neither musical nor fond of books, her preference is for
handwork&mdash;and day dreaming. She was often absent-minded,
misread in a peculiar way when reading aloud, instead of the
word <em>Ziege</em> (goat), for instance, said <em>Gais</em>, instead of <em>Treppe</em>
(stair), <em>Stege</em>; this occurred so often that her brothers and
sisters laughed at her. There were no other abnormalities;
there were no serious hysterical manifestations. Her family
were artisans and business people with very limited interests.
Books of mystical content were never permitted in the family.
Her education was faulty; there were numerous brothers
and sisters and thus the education was given indiscriminately,
and in addition the children had to suffer a great deal
from the inconsequent and vulgar, indeed sometimes rough,
treatment of their mother. The father, a very busy business
man, could not pay much attention to his children, and died
when S. W. was not yet grown up. Under these uncomfortable
conditions it is no wonder that S. W. felt herself shut in
and unhappy. She was often afraid to go home, and preferred
to be anywhere rather than there. She was left a great deal
with playmates and grew up in this way without much polish.
The level of her education is relatively low and her interests
correspondingly limited. Her knowledge of literature is also
very limited. She knows the common school songs by heart,
songs of Schiller and Goethe and a few other poets, as well
as fragments from a song book and the psalms. Newspaper
stories represent her highest level in prose. Up to the time
of her somnambulism she had never read any books of a
serious nature. At home and from friends she heard about
table-turning and began to take an interest in it. She asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to be allowed to take part in such experiments, and her desire
was soon gratified. In July 1899, she took part a few times
in table-turnings with some friends and her brothers and
sisters, but in joke. It was then discovered that she was
an excellent "medium." Some communications of a serious
nature arrived which were received with general astonishment.
Their pastoral tone was surprising. The spirit said
he was the grandfather of the medium. As I was acquainted
with the family I was able to take part in these experiments.
At the beginning of August, 1899, the first attacks of somnambulism
took place in my presence. They took the following
course: S. W. became very pale, slowly sank to the
ground, or into a chair, shut her eyes, became cataleptic,
drew several deep breaths, and began to speak. In this stage
she was generally quite relaxed; the reflexes of the lids remained,
as did also tactile sensation. She was sensitive to
unexpected noises and full of fear, especially in the initial
stage.</p>

<p>She did not react when called by name. In somnambulic
dialogues she copied in a remarkably clever way her dead
relations and acquaintances, with all their peculiarities, so
that she made a lasting impression upon unprejudiced
persons. She also so closely imitated persons whom she
only knew from descriptions that no one could deny her at
least considerable talent as an actress. Gradually gestures
were added to the simple speech, which finally led to "<em>attitudes
passionelles</em>" and complete dramatic scenes. She took up
postures of prayer and rapture, with staring eyes, and spoke
with impassionate and glowing rhetoric. She then made use
exclusively of a literary German which she spoke with an ease
and assurance quite contrary to her usual uncertain and
embarrassed manner in the waking state. Her movements
were free and of a noble grace, depicting most beautifully
her varying emotions. Her attitude during these states was
always changing and diverse in the different attacks. Now
she would lie for ten minutes to two hours on the sofa or
the ground, motionless, with closed eyes; now she assumed a
half-sitting posture and spoke with changed tone and speech;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
now she would stand up, going through every possible
pantomimic gesture. Her speech was equally diversified and
without rule. Now she spoke in the first person, but
never for long, generally to prophesy her next attack; now
she spoke of herself (and this was the most usual) in the
third person. She then acted as some other person, either
some dead acquaintance or some chance person, whose part
she consistently carried out according to the characteristics
she herself conceived. At the end of the ecstasy there
usually followed a cataleptic state with <em>flexibilitas cerea</em>,
which gradually passed over into the waking state. The
waxy anæmic pallor which was an almost constant feature
of the attacks made one really anxious; it sometimes occurred
at the beginning of the attack, but often in the second
half only. The pulse was then small but regular and of
normal frequency; the breathing gentle, shallow, or almost
imperceptible. As already stated, S. W. often predicted her
attacks beforehand; just before the attacks she had strange
sensations, became excited, rather anxious, and occasionally
expressed thoughts of death: "she will probably die in one
of these attacks; during the attack her soul only hangs to
her body by a thread, so that often the body could scarcely
go on living." Once after the cataleptic attack tachypn&oelig;a
lasting two minutes was observed, with a respiration rate of
100 per minute. At first the attacks occurred spontaneously,
afterwards S. W. could provoke them by sitting in a dark
corner and covering her face with her hands. Frequently
the experiment did not succeed. She had so-called "good"
and "bad" days. The question of amnesia after the attacks
is unfortunately very obscure. This much is certain, that
after each attack she was quite accurately orientated as to
what she had gone through "during the rapture." It is,
however, uncertain how much she remembered of the conversations
in which she served as medium, and of changes
in her surroundings during the attack. It often seemed
that she did have a fleeting recollection, for directly after
waking she would ask: "Who was here? Wasn't X or Y
here? What did he say?" She also showed that she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
superficially aware of the content of the conversations. She
thus often remarked that the spirits had communicated to her
before waking what they had said. But frequently this was
not the case. If, at her request, the contents of the trance
speeches were repeated to her she was often annoyed about
them. She was then often sad and depressed for hours
together, especially when any unpleasant indiscretions had
occurred. She would then rail against the spirits and
assert that next time she would beg her guides to keep
such spirits far away. Her indignation was not feigned, for
in the waking state she could but poorly control herself and
her emotions, so that every mood was at once mirrored in
her face. At times she seemed only slightly or not at all
aware of the external proceedings during the attack. She
seldom noticed when any one left the room or came in.
Once she forbade me to enter the room when she was awaiting
special communications which she wished to keep secret
from me. Nevertheless I went in, and sat down with the
three other sitters and listened to everything. Her eyes
were open and she spoke to those present without noticing
me. She only noticed me when I began to speak, which
gave rise to a storm of indignation. She remembered
better, but still apparently only in indefinite outlines, the
remarks of those taking part which referred to the trance
speeches or directly to herself. I could never discover any
definite rapport in this connection.</p>

<p>In addition to these great attacks which seemed to follow
a certain law in their course, S. W. produced a great number
of other automatisms. Premonitions, forebodings, unaccountable
moods and rapidly changing fancies were all in the day's
work. I never observed simple states of sleep. On the other
hand, I soon noticed that in the middle of a lively conversation
S. W. became quite confused and spoke without meaning in a
peculiar monotonous way, and looked in front of her dreamily
with half-closed eyes. These lapses usually lasted but a few
minutes. Then she would suddenly proceed: "Yes, what
did you say?" At first she would not give any particulars
about these lapses, she would reply off-hand that she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a little giddy, had a headache, and so on. Later she simply
said: "they were there again," meaning her spirits. She
was subjected to the lapses much against her will; she
often tried to defend herself: "I do not want to, not now,
come some other time; you seem to think I only exist for
you." She had these lapses in the streets, in business, in
fact anywhere. If this happened to her in the street, she
leaned against a house and waited till the attack was over.
During these attacks, whose intensity was most variable, she
had visions; frequently also, especially during the attacks
where she turned extremely pale, she "wandered"; or as
she expressed it, lost her body, and got away to distant
places whither her spirits led her. Distant journeys during
ecstasy strained her exceedingly; she was often exhausted
for hours after, and many times complained that the spirits
had again deprived her of much power, such overstrain was
now too much for her; the spirits must get another medium,
etc. Once she was hysterically blind for half an hour after
one of these ecstasies. Her gait was hesitating, feeling her
way; she had to be led; she did not see the candle which
was on the table. The pupils reacted. Visions occurred in
great numbers without proper "lapses" (designating by this
word only the higher grade of distraction of attention). At
first the visions only occurred at the beginning of the sleep.
Once after S. W. had gone to bed the room became lighted
up, and out of the general foggy light there appeared white
glittering figures. They were throughout concealed in white
veil-like robes, the women had a head-covering like a turban,
and a girdle. Afterwards (according to the statements of
S. W.), "the spirits were already there" when she went to bed.
Finally she also saw the figures in bright daylight, though
still somewhat blurred and only for a short time, provided
there were no proper lapses, in which case the figures became
solid enough to take hold of. But S. W. always preferred
darkness. According to her account the content of the vision
was for the most part of a pleasant kind. Gazing at the
beautiful figures she received a feeling of delicious blessedness.
More rarely there were terrible visions of a dæmonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
nature. These were entirely confined to the night or to dark
rooms. Occasionally S. W. saw black figures in the neighbouring
streets or in her room; once out in the dark courtyard
she saw a terrible copper-red face which suddenly stared
at her and frightened her. I could not learn anything satisfactory
about the first occurrence of the vision. She states
that once at night, in her fifth or sixth year, she saw her
"guide," her grandfather (whom she had never known). I
could not get any objective confirmation from her relatives of
this early vision. Nothing of the kind is said to have happened
until her first séance. With the exception of the hypnagogic
brightness and the flashes, there were no rudimentary hallucinations,
but from the beginning they were of a systematic
nature, involving all the sense-organs equally. So far as
concerns the intellectual reaction to these phenomena it
is remarkable with what curious sincerity she regarded her
dreams. Her entire somnambulic development, the innumerable
puzzling events, seemed to her quite natural.
She looked at her whole past in this light. Every striking
event of earlier years stood to her in necessary and clear
relationship to her present condition. She was happy in the
consciousness of having found her real life-task. Naturally
she was unswervingly convinced of the reality of her visions.
I often tried to present her with some sceptical explanation,
but she invariably turned this aside; in her usual condition
she did not clearly grasp a reasoned explanation, and in the
semi-somnambulic state she regarded it as senseless in view
of the facts staring her in the face. She once said: "I do
not know if what the spirits say and teach me is true, neither
do I know if they are those by whose names they call themselves,
but that my spirits exist there is no question. I see
them before me, I can touch them, I speak to them about
everything I wish, as naturally as I'm now talking to you.
They must be real." She absolutely would not listen to the
idea that the manifestations were a kind of illness. Doubts
about her health or about the reality of her dream would
distress her deeply; she felt so hurt by my remarks that
when I was present she became reserved, and for a long time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
refused to experiment if I was there; hence I took care not
to express my doubts and thoughts aloud. From her immediate
relatives and acquaintances she received undivided
allegiance and admiration&mdash;they asked her advice about all
kinds of things. In time she obtained such an influence
upon her followers that three of her brothers and sisters likewise
began to have hallucinations of a similar kind. Their
hallucinations generally began as night-dreams of a very vivid
and dramatic kind; these gradually extended into the waking
time, partly hypnagogic, partly hypnopompic. A married
sister had extraordinary vivid dreams which developed from
night to night, and these appeared in the waking consciousness;
at first as obscure illusions, next as real hallucinations, but
they never reached the plastic clearness of S. W.'s visions.
For instance, she once saw in a dream a black dæmonic
figure at her bedside in animated conversation with a white,
beautiful figure, which tried to restrain the black one; nevertheless
the black one seized her and tried to choke her, then
she awoke. Bending over her she then saw a black shadow
with a human contour, and near by a white cloudy figure.
The vision only disappeared when she lighted a candle.
Similar visions were repeated dozens of times. The visions
of the other two sisters were of a similar kind, but less intense.</p>

<p>This particular type of attack with the complete visions
and ideas had developed in the course of less than a
month, but never afterwards exceeded these limits. What
was later added to these was but the extension of all
those thoughts and cycles of visions which to a certain
extent were already indicated quite at the beginning. As
well as the "great" attacks and the lesser ones, there must
also be noted a third kind of state comparable to "lapse"
states. These are the <em>semi-somnambulic states</em>. They
appeared at the beginning or at the end of the "great"
attacks, but also appeared without any connection with them.
They developed gradually in the course of the first month.
It is not possible to give a more precise account of the time
of their appearance. In this state a fixed gaze, brilliant
eyes, and a certain dignity and stateliness of movement are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
noticeable. In this phase S. W. is herself, her own somnambulic ego.</p>

<p>She is fully orientated to the external world, but seems
to stand with one foot, as it were, in her dream-world. She
sees and hears her spirits, sees how they walk about in the
room among those who form the circle, and stand first by
one person, then by another. She is in possession of a clear
remembrance of her visions, her journeys and the instructions
she receives. She speaks quietly, clearly and firmly and
is always in a serious, almost religious frame of mind. Her
bearing indicates a deeply religious mood, free from all
pietistic flavour, her speech is singularly uninfluenced by
her guide's jargon compounded of Bible and tract. Her
solemn behaviour has a suffering, rather pitiful aspect. She
is painfully conscious of the great differences between her
ideal world at night and the rough reality of the day. This
state stands in sharp contrast to her waking existence; there
is here no trace of that unstable and inharmonious creature,
that extravagant nervous temperament which is so characteristic
for the rest of her relationships. Speaking with her,
you get the impression of speaking with a much older person
who has attained through numerous experiences to a sure
harmonious footing. In this state she produced her best
results, whilst her romances correspond more closely to the
conditions of her waking interests. The semi-somnambulism
usually appears spontaneously, mostly during the table
experiments, which sometimes announced by this means that
S. W. was beginning to know beforehand every automatic
communication from the table. She then usually stopped
the table-turning and after a short time passed more or less
suddenly into an ecstatic state. S. W. showed herself to
be very sensitive. She could divine and reply to simple
questions thought of by a member of the circle who was
not a "medium," if only the latter would lay a hand on the
table or on her hand. Genuine thought-transference without
direct or indirect contact could never be achieved. In
juxtaposition with the obvious development of her whole
personality the continued existence of her earlier ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
character was all the more startling. She imparted with
unconcealed pleasure all the little childish experiences, the
flirtations and love-secrets, all the rudeness and lack of
education of her parents and contemporaries. To every one
who did not know her secret she was a girl of fifteen and a
half, in no respect unlike a thousand other such girls. So
much the greater was people's astonishment when they got
to know her in her other aspect. Her near relatives could
not at first grasp this change: to some extent they never
altogether understood it, so there was often bitter strife in
the family, some of them taking sides for and others against
S. W., either with enthusiastic over-valuation or with contemptuous
censure of "superstition." Thus did S. W.,
during the time I watched her closely, lead a curious, contradictory
life, a real "double life" with two personalities
existing side by side or closely following upon one another
and contending for the mastery. I now give some of the
most interesting details of the sittings in chronological order.</p>

<p>First and second sittings, August, 1899. S. W. at once
undertook to lead the "communications." The "psychograph,"
for which an upturned glass tumbler was used, on
which two fingers of the right hand were laid, moved quick as
lightning from letter to letter. (Slips of paper, marked with
letter and numbers, had been arranged in a circle round the
glass.) It was communicated that the "medium's" grandfather
was present and would speak to us. There then
followed many communications in quick sequence, of a most
religious, edifying nature, in part in properly made words,
partly in words with the letters transposed, and partly in a
series of reversed letters. The last words and sentences were
produced so quickly that it was not possible to follow without
first inverting the letters. The communications were once
interrupted in abrupt fashion by a new communication, which
announced the presence of the writer's grandfather. On this
occasion the jesting observation was made: "Evidently the
two 'spirits' get on very badly together." During this
attempt darkness came on. Suddenly S. W. became very
disturbed, sprang up in terror, fell on her knees and cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
"There, there, do you not see that light, that star there?"
and pointed to a dark corner of the room. She became more
and more disturbed, and called for a light in terror. She was
pale, wept, "it was all so strange, she did not know in the
least what was the matter with her." When a candle was
brought she became calm again. The experiments were now
stopped.</p>

<p>At the next sitting, which took place in the evening, two
days later, similar communications from S. W.'s grandfather
were obtained. When darkness fell S. W. suddenly leaned
back on the sofa, grew pale, almost shut her eyes, and lay
there motionless. The eyeballs were turned upwards, the
lid-reflex was present as well as tactile sensation. The
breathing was gentle, almost imperceptible. The pulse small
and weak. This attack lasted about half an hour, when
S. W. suddenly sighed and got up. The extreme pallor,
which had lasted throughout the whole attack, now gave
place to her usual pale pink colour. She was somewhat
confused and distraught, indicated that she had seen all
sorts of things, but would tell nothing. Only after urgent
questioning would she relate that in an extraordinary waking
condition she had seen her grandfather arm-in-arm with the
writer's grandfather. The two had gone rapidly by in an
open carriage, side by side.</p>

<p>III. In the third séance, which took place some days
later, there was a similar attack of more than half an hour's
duration. S. W. afterwards told of many white, transfigured
forms who each gave her a flower of special symbolic significance.
Most of them were dead relatives. Concerning the
exact content of their talk she maintained an obstinate silence.</p>

<p>IV. After S. W. had entered into the somnambulic state
she began to make curious movements with her lips, and
made swallowing gurgling noises. Then she whispered
very softly and unintelligibly. When this had lasted some
minutes she suddenly began to speak in an altered deep
voice. She spoke of herself in the third person. "She is
not here, she has gone away." There followed several communications
of a religious kind. From the content and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
way of speaking it was easy to conclude that she was imitating
her grandfather, who had been a clergyman. The content of
the talk did not rise above the mental level of the "communications."
The tone of the voice was somewhat forced,
and only became natural when, in the course of the talk, the
voice approximated to the medium's own.</p>

<p>(In later sittings the voice was only altered for a few
moments when a new spirit manifested itself.)</p>

<p>Afterwards there was amnesia for the trance-conversation.
She gave hints about a sojourn in the other world,
and she spoke of an undreamed-of blessedness which she felt.
It must be further noted that her conversation in the
attack occurred quite spontaneously, and was not in response
to any suggestions.</p>

<p>Directly after this séance S. W. became acquainted with
the book of Justinus Kerner, "Die Seherin von Prevorst."
She began thereupon to magnetise herself towards the end of
the attack, partly by means of regular passes, partly by
curious circles and figures of eight, which she described
symmetrically with both arms. She did this, she said, to
disperse the severe headaches which occurred after the
attacks. In the August séances, not detailed here, there
were in addition to the grandfather numerous spirits of
other relatives who did not produce anything very remarkable.
Each time when a new one came on the scene the
movement of the glass was changed in a striking way; it
generally ran along the rows of letters, touching one or other
of them, but no sense could be made of it. The orthography
was very uncertain and arbitrary, and the first
sentences were frequently incomprehensible or broken up
into a meaningless medley of letters. Generally automatic
writing suddenly began at this point. Sometimes automatic
writing was attempted during complete darkness. The
movements began with violent backward jerks of the
whole arm, so that the paper was pierced by the pencil.
The first attempt at writing consisted of numerous strokes
and zigzag lines about 8 cm. high. In later attempts there
came first unreadable words, in large handwriting, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
gradually became smaller and clearer. It was not essentially
different from the medium's own. The grandfather was
again the controlling spirit.</p>

<p>V. Somnambulic attacks in September, 1899. S. W. sits
upon the sofa, leans back, shuts her eyes, breathes lightly
and regularly. She gradually becomes cataleptic, the catalepsy
disappears after about two minutes, when she lies in an
apparently quiet sleep with complete muscular relaxation.
She suddenly begins to speak in a subdued voice: "No! you
take the red, I'll take the white, you can take the green, and
you the blue. Are you ready? We will go now." (A pause
of several minutes during which her face assumes a corpse-like
pallor. Her hands feel cold and are very bloodless.) She
suddenly calls out with a loud, solemn voice: "Albert,
Albert, Albert," then whispering: "Now you speak," followed
by a longer pause, when the pallor of the face attains the
highest possible degree. Again, in a loud solemn voice,
"Albert, Albert, do you not believe your father? I tell you
many errors are contained in N.'s teaching. Think about
it." Pause. The pallor of the face decreases. "He's very
frightened. He could not speak any more." (These words
in her usual conversational tone.) Pause. "He will certainly
think about it," S. W. now speaks again in the same tone,
in a strange idiom which sounds like French or Italian,
now recalling the former, now the latter. She speaks
fluently, rapidly, and with charm. It is possible to understand
a few words but not to remember the whole, because
the language is so strange. From time to time certain
words recur, as <em>wena</em>, <em>wenes</em>, <em>wenai</em>, <em>wene</em>, etc. The absolute
naturalness of the proceedings is bewildering. From
time to time she pauses as if some one were answering
her. Suddenly she speaks in German, "Is time already
up?" (In a troubled voice.) "Must I go already? Goodbye,
goodbye." With the last words there passes over her
face an indescribable expression of ecstatic blessedness. She
raises her arms, opens her eyes,&mdash;hitherto closed,&mdash;looks
radiantly upwards. She remains a moment thus, then her
arms sink slackly, her eyes shut, the expression of her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
is tired and exhausted. After a short cataleptic stage she
awakes with a sigh. She looks around astonished: "I've
slept again, haven't I?" She is told she has been talking
during the sleep, whereupon she becomes much annoyed,
and this increases when she learns she has spoken in a
foreign tongue. "But didn't I tell the spirits I don't want
it? It mustn't be. It exhausts me too much." Begins to
cry. "Oh, God! Oh, God! must then everything, everything,
come back again like last time? Is nothing spared me?"
The next day at the same time there was another attack.
When S. W. has fallen asleep Ulrich von Gerbenstein suddenly
announces himself. He is an entertaining chatterer,
speaks very fluently in high German with a North-German
accent. Asked what S. W. is now doing, after much circumlocution
he explains that she is far away, and he is meanwhile
here to look after her body, the circulation of the blood, the
respiration, etc. He must take care that meanwhile no
black person takes possession of her and harms her. Upon
urgent questioning he relates that S. W. has gone with the
others to Japan, to appear to a distant relative and to
restrain him from a stupid marriage. He then announces
in a whisper the exact moment when the manifestation takes
place. Forbidden any conversation for a few minutes, he
points to the sudden pallor occurring in S. W., remarking
that materialisation at such a great distance is at the cost of
correspondingly great force. He then orders cold bandages
to the head to alleviate the severe headache which would
occur afterwards. As the colour of the face gradually
becomes more natural the conversation grows livelier. All
kinds of childish jokes and trivialities are uttered; suddenly
U. von G. says, "I see them coming, but they are still very
far off; I see them there like a star." S. W. points to
the North. We are naturally astonished, and ask why they
do not come from the East, whereto U. von G. laughingly
retorts: "Oh, but they come the direct way over the North
Pole. I am going now; farewell." Immediately after S. W.
sighs, wakes up, is ill-tempered, complains of extremely bad
headache. She saw U. von G. standing by her body; what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
had he told us? She gets angry about the "silly chatter"
from which he cannot refrain.</p>

<p>VI. Begins in the usual way. Extreme pallor; lies
stretched out, scarcely breathing. Speaks suddenly, with
loud, solemn voice: "Yes, be frightened; I am; I warn
you against N.'s teaching. See, in hope is everything that
belongs to faith. You would like to know who I am. God
gives where one least expects it. Do you not know me?"
Then unintelligible whispering; after a few minutes she
awakes.</p>

<p>VII. S. W. soon falls asleep; lies stretched out on the
sofa. Is very pale. Says nothing, sighs deeply from time
to time. Casts up her eyes, rises, sits on the sofa, bends
forward, speaks softly: "You have sinned grievously, have
fallen far." Bends forward still, as if speaking to some one
who kneels before her. She stands up, turns to the right,
stretches out her hands, and points to the spot over which
she has been bending. "Will you forgive her?" she asks,
loudly. "Do not forgive men, but their spirits. Not she,
but her human body has sinned." Then she kneels down,
remains quite still for about ten minutes in the attitude of
prayer. Then she gets up suddenly, looks to heaven with
ecstatic expression, and then throws herself again on her
knees, with her face bowed on her hands, whispering incomprehensible
words. She remains rigid in this position
several minutes. Then she gets up, looks again upwards
with a radiant countenance, and lies down on the sofa; soon
after she wakes.</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Development of the Somnambulic Personalities.</span></p>

<p>At the beginning of many séances the glass was allowed
to move by itself, when occasionally the advice followed in
stereotyped fashion: "You must ask."</p>

<p>Since convinced spiritualists took part in the séances, all
kinds of spiritualistic wonders were of course demanded, and
especially the "protecting spirits." In reply, sometimes
names of well-known dead people were produced, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
unknown names, <i>e.g.</i> Berthe de Valours, Elizabeth von Thierfelsenburg,
Ulrich von Gerbenstein, etc. The controlling
spirit was almost without exception the medium's grandfather,
who once explained: "he loved her more than any one
in this world because he had protected her from childhood
up, and knew all her thoughts." This personality produced
a flood of Biblical maxims, edifying observations, and song-book
verses; the following is a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span style="margin-left: 5em;">In true believing,</span></div>
  <div class="i0">To faith in God cling ever nigh,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy heavenly comfort never leaving,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which having, man can never die.</div>
  <div class="i0">Refuge in God is peace for ever,</div>
  <div class="i0">When earthly cares oppress the mind;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who from the heart can pray is never</div>
  <div class="i0">Bowed down by fate, howe'er unkind.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Numerous similar elaborations betrayed by their banal,
unctuous contents their origin in some tract or other. When
S. W. had to speak in ecstasy, lively dialogues developed
between the circle-members and the somnambulic personality.
The content of the answers received is essentially just the
same commonplace edifying stuff as that of the psychographic
communications. The character of this personality
is distinguished by its dry and tedious solemnity, rigorous
conventionality and pietistic virtue (which is not consistent
with the historic reality). The grandfather is the medium's
guide and protector. During the ecstatic state he gives all
kinds of advice, prophesies later attacks and the visions she
will see on waking, etc. He orders cold bandages, gives
directions concerning the medium's lying down or the date
of the séances. His relationship to the medium is an extremely
tender one. In liveliest contrast to this heavy dream-person
stands a personality, appearing first sporadically,
in the psychographic communications of the first séance. It
soon disclosed itself as the dead brother of a Mr. R., who
was then taking part in the séance. This dead brother, Mr.
P. R., was full of commonplaces about brotherly love towards
his living brother. He evaded particular questions in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
manner of ways. But he developed a quite astonishing
eloquence towards the ladies of the circle and in particular
offered his allegiance to one whom Mr. P. R. had never
known when alive. He affirmed that he had already cared
very much for her in his lifetime, had often met her in the
street without knowing who she was, and was now uncommonly
delighted to become acquainted with her in this
unusual manner. With such insipid compliments, scornful
remarks to the men, harmless childish jokes, etc., he took up
a large part of the séance. Several of the members found
fault with the frivolity and banality of this "spirit," whereupon
he disappeared for one or two séances, but soon
reappeared, at first well-behaved, often indeed uttering
Christian maxims, but soon dropping back into the old
tone. Besides these two sharply differentiated personalities,
others appeared who varied but little from the grandfather's
type; they were mostly dead relatives of the medium. The
general atmosphere of the first two months' séances was
accordingly solemnly edifying, disturbed only from time to
time by Mr. P. R.'s trivial chatter. Some weeks after the
beginning of the séances, Mr. R. left our circle, whereupon
a remarkable change took place in Mr. P. R.'s conversation.
He became monosyllabic, came less often, and after a few
séances vanished altogether, later on he reappeared but with
great infrequency, and for the most part only when the
medium was alone with the particular lady mentioned. Then
a new personality forced himself into the foreground; in
contrast to Mr. P. R., who always spoke the Swiss dialect,
this gentleman adopted an affected North-German way of
speaking. In all else he was an exact copy of Mr. P. R. His
eloquence was somewhat remarkable, since S. W. had only a
very scanty knowledge of high German, whilst this new personality,
who called himself Ulrich von Gerbenstein, spoke
an almost faultless German, rich in charming phrases and
compliments.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Ulrich von Gerbenstein was a witty chatterer, full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
repartee, an idler, a great admirer of the ladies, frivolous,
and most superficial.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1899-1900 he gradually came to
dominate the situation more and more, and took over one by
one all the above-mentioned functions of the grandfather, so
that under his influence the serious character of the séances
disappeared.</p>

<p>All suggestions to the contrary proved unavailing, and at
last the séances had on this account to be suspended for
longer and longer intervals. There is a peculiarity common
to all these somnambulic personalities which must be noted.
They have access to the medium's memory, even to the
unconscious portion, they are also <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au courant</i> with the visions
which she has in the ecstatic state, but they have only <em>the
most superficial knowledge of her phantasies during the ecstasy</em>.
Of the somnambulic dreams they know only what they occasionally
pick up from the members of the circle. On doubtful
points they can give no information, or only such as contradicts
the medium's explanations. The stereotyped answer to these
questions runs: "Ask Ivenes."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> "Ivenes knows." From
the examples given of different ecstatic moments it is clear
that the medium's consciousness is by no means idle during
the trance, but develops a striking and multiplex phantastic
activity. For the reconstruction of S. W.'s somnambulic
self we have to depend altogether upon her several statements;
for in the first place her spontaneous utterances
connecting her with the waking self are few, and often
irrelevant, and in the second very many of these ecstatic
states go by without gesture, and without speech, so that no
conclusions as to the inner happenings can afterwards be
drawn from the external appearances. <em>S. W. is almost totally
amnesic for the automatic phenomena during ecstasy as far as
they come within the territory of the new personalities of her ego.
Of all the other phenomena, such as loud talking, babbling, etc.,
which are directly connected with her own ego she usually has a
clear remembrance.</em> But in every case there is complete
amnesia only during the first few minutes after the ecstasy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Within the first half-hour, during which there usually prevails
a kind of semi-somnambulism with a dreamlike manner,
hallucinations, etc., the amnesia gradually disappears, whilst
fragmentary memories emerge of what has occurred, but in a
quite irregular and arbitrary fashion.</p>

<p>The later séances were usually begun by our hands being
joined and laid on the table, whereon the table at once began
to move. Meanwhile S. W. gradually became somnambulic,
took her hands from the table, lay back on the sofa, and fell
into the ecstatic sleep. She sometimes related her experiences
to us afterwards, but showed herself very reticent if strangers
were present. After the very first ecstasy she indicated that
she played a distinguished <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> among the spirits. She had
a special name, as had each of the spirits; hers was <em>Ivenes</em>;
her grandfather looked after her with particular care. In the
ecstasy with the flower-vision we learnt her special secret,
hidden till then beneath the deepest silence. During the
séances in which her spirit spoke she made long journeys,
mostly to relatives, to whom she said she appeared, or she found
herself on the Other Side, in "That space between the stars
which people think is empty, but in which there are really very
many spirit-worlds." In the semi-somnambulic state which
frequently followed her attacks, she once described, in peculiar
poetic fashion, a landscape on the Other Side, "a wondrous,
moon-lit valley, set aside for the races not yet born." She
represented her somnambulic ego as being almost completely
released from the body. It is a fully-grown but small, black-haired
woman, of pronounced Jewish type, clothed in white
garments, her head covered with a turban. She understands
and speaks the language of the spirits, "for spirits still,
from old human custom, do speak to one another, although
they do not really need to, since they mutually understand
one another's thoughts." She "does not really always talk
with the spirits, but just looks at them, and so understands
their thoughts." She travels in the company of four or
five spirits, dead relatives, and visits her living relatives
and acquaintances in order to investigate their life and their
way of thinking; she further visits all places which lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
within the radius of these spectral inhabitants. From her
acquaintanceship with Kerner's book, she discovered and
improved upon the ideas of the black spirits who are kept
enchanted in certain places, or exist partly beneath the
earth's surface (compare the "Seherin von Prevorst").
This activity caused her much trouble and pain; in and
after the ecstasy she complained of suffocating feelings,
violent headache, etc. But every fortnight, on Wednesdays,
she could pass the whole night in the garden on the Other
Side in the company of holy spirits. There she was taught
everything concerning the forces of the world, the endless
complicated relationships and affinities of human beings, and
all besides about the laws of reincarnation, the inhabitants
of the stars, etc. Unfortunately only the system of the
world-forces and reincarnation achieved any expression.
As to the other matters she only let fall disconnected
observations. For example, once she returned from a railway
journey in an extremely disturbed state. It was thought
at first something unpleasant had happened, till she managed
to compose herself, and said, "A star-inhabitant had sat
opposite to her in the train." From the description which
she gave of this being, I recognised a well-known elderly
merchant I happened to know, who has a rather unsympathetic
face. In connection with this experience she related
all kinds of peculiarities of these star-dwellers; they have
no god-like souls, as men have, they pursue no science, no
philosophy, but in technical arts they are far more advanced
than men. Thus on Mars a flying-machine has long been
in existence; the whole of Mars is covered with canals,
these canals are cleverly excavated lakes and serve for
irrigation. The canals are quite superficial; the water in
them is very shallow. The excavating caused the inhabitants
of Mars no particular trouble, for the soil there is
lighter than the earth's. The canals are nowhere bridged,
but that does not prevent communication, for everything
travels by flying-machine. Wars no longer occur on the
stars, for no differences of opinion exist. The star-dwellers
have not human bodies, but the most laughable ones possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
such as one would never imagine. Human spirits who are
allowed to travel on the Other Side may not set foot on the
stars. Equally, wandering star-dwellers may not come to
the earth, but must remain at a distance of twenty-five
metres above the earth's surface. Should they transgress
they remain in the power of the earth, and must assume
human bodies, and are only set free again after their natural
death. As men, they are cold, hard-hearted, cruel. S. W.
recognises them by a singular expression in which the
"Spiritual" is lacking, and by their hairless, eyebrowless,
sharply-cut faces. Napoleon was a star-dweller.</p>

<p>In her journeys she does not see the places through
which she hastens. She has a feeling of floating, and the
spirits tell her when she is at the right spot. Then, as a
rule, she only sees the face and upper part of the person
to whom she is supposed to appear, or whom she wishes to
see. She can seldom say in what kind of surroundings she
sees this person. Occasionally she saw me, but only my
head without any surroundings. She occupied herself much
with the enchanting of spirits, and for this purpose she
wrote oracular sayings in a foreign tongue, on slips of paper
which she concealed in all sorts of queer places. An Italian
murderer, presumably living in my house, and whom she
called Conventi, was specially displeasing to her. She tried
several times to cast a spell upon him, and without my knowledge
hid several papers about, on which messages were
written; these were later found by chance. One such, written
in red ink, was as follows:</p>

<div class="bord1">
<p class="center">Conventi</p>
<p class="center">Marche. 4 govi</p>
<p class="center"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ivenes.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="bord1">

<p class="center">orden, Astaf</p>
<p class="center">vent.</p>
</div>

<div class="bord2">

<p class="center">ton prost afta ben genallis.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I never obtained any interpretation of this.
S. W. was quite inaccessible in this matter. Occasionally
the somnambulic Ivenes speaks directly to the public. She
does so in dignified fashion, rather precociously, but she is
not wearisomely unctuous and impossibly twaddling as are
her two guides; she is a serious, mature person, devout and
pious, full of womanly tenderness and great modesty, always
yielding to the judgments of others. This expression of
plaintive emotion and melancholy resignation is peculiar to
her. She looks beyond this world, and unwillingly returns to
reality; she bemoans her hard lot, and her unsympathetic
family surroundings. Associated with this there is something
elevated about her; she commands her spirits, despises the
twaddling chatter of Gerbenstein, consoles others, directs
those in distress, warns and protects them from dangers to
body and soul. She is the intermediary for the entire intellectual
output of all manifestations, but she herself ascribes
it to the direction of the spirits. It is Ivenes who entirely
controls S. W.'s semi-somnambulic state.</p>

<p>In semi-somnambulism S. W. gave some of those taking
part in the séances the opportunity to compare her with
the "Seherin von Prevorst" (Prophetess of Prevorst). This
suggestion was not without results. S. W. gave hints of
earlier existences which she had already lived through, and
after a few weeks she suddenly disclosed a whole system
of reincarnations, although she had never before mentioned
anything of the kind. Ivenes is a spiritual being who is
something more than the spirits of other human beings.
Every human spirit must incorporate himself twice in the
course of the centuries. But Ivenes must incorporate herself
at least once every two hundred years; besides herself only
two other persons have participated in this fate, namely,
Swedenborg and Miss Florence Cook (Crookes's famous
medium). S. W. calls these two personages her brother and
sister. She gave no information about their pre-existences.
In the beginning of the nineteenth century Ivenes was Frau
Hauffe, the Prophetess of Prevorst; at the end of the
eighteenth century, a clergyman's wife in central Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
(locality unknown). As the latter she was seduced by Goethe
and bore him a child. In the fifteenth century she was a
Saxon countess, and had the poetic name of Thierfelsenburg.
Ulrich von Gerbenstein is a relative from that line. The
interval of 300 years, and her adventure with Goethe, must
be atoned for by the sorrows of the Prophetess of Prevorst.
In the thirteenth century she was a noblewoman of Southern
France, called de Valours, and was burnt as a witch.
From the thirteenth century to the Christian persecution
under Nero there were numerous reincarnations of which
S. W. could give no detailed account. In the Christian
persecution under Nero she played a martyr's part. Then
comes a period of obscurity till the time of David, when
Ivenes was an ordinary Jewess. After her death she received
from Astaf, an angel from a high heaven, the mandate for
her future wonderful career. In all her pre-existences she
was a medium and an intermediary in the intercourse
between this side and the other. Her brothers and sisters
are equally old and have the like vocation. In her various
pre-existences she was sometimes married, and in this way
gradually founded a whole system of relationships with
whose endless complicated inter-relations she occupied herself
in many ecstasies. Thus, for example, about the eighth
century she was the mother of her earthly father and, moreover,
of her grandfather, and mine. Hence the striking
friendship of these two old gentlemen, otherwise strangers.
As Mme. de Valours she was the present writer's mother.
When she was burnt as a witch the writer took it much to
heart, and went into a cloister at Rouen, wore a grey habit,
became Prior, wrote a work on Botany and died at over eighty
years of age. In the refectory of the cloister there hung a
picture of Mme. de Valours, in which she was depicted in a
half-reclining position. (S. W. in the semi-somnambulic
state often took this position on the sofa. It corresponds
exactly to that of Mme. Recamier in David's well-known
picture.) A gentleman who often took part in the
séances, who had some slight resemblance to the writer,
was also one of her sons from that period. Around this core<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of relationship there grouped themselves, more or less
intimately connected, all the persons in any way related
or known to her. One came from the fifteenth century,
another&mdash;a cousin&mdash;from the eighteenth century, and so
on.</p>

<p>From the three great family stocks grew by far the
greater part of the present European peoples. She and her
brothers and sisters are descended from Adam, who arose by
materialisation; the other then-existing families, from whom
Cain took his wife, were descended from apes. S. W. produced
from this circle of relationship an extensive family-gossip,
a very flood of romantic stories, piquant adventures,
etc. Sometimes the target of her romances was a lady
acquaintance of the writer's who for some undiscoverable
reason was peculiarly antipathetic to her. She declared
that this lady was an incarnation of a celebrated Parisian
poisoner, who had achieved great notoriety in the eighteenth
century. She maintained that this lady still continued her
dangerous work, but in a much more ingenious way than
formerly; through the inspiration of the wicked spirits who
accompany her she had discovered a liquid which when
merely exposed to the air attracted tubercle bacilli and
formed a splendid developing medium for them. By means
of this liquid, which she was wont to mix with the food,
the lady had brought about the death of her husband (who
had indeed died of tuberculosis); also one of her lovers,
and of her own brother, for the sake of his inheritance. Her
eldest son was an illegitimate child by her lover. As a
widow she had secretly borne to another lover an illegitimate
child, and finally she had had an unnatural relationship with
her own brother (who was later on poisoned). In this way
S. W. spun innumerable stories, in which she believed quite
implicitly. The persons of these stories appeared in the
drama of her visions, as did the lady before referred to, going
through the pantomime of making confession and receiving
absolution of sins. Everything interesting occurring in her
surroundings was incorporated in this system of romances,
and given an order in the network of relationships with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
more or less exact statement as to their pre-existences and
the spirits influencing them. It fared thus with all who
made S. W.'s acquaintance: they were valued at a second
or first incarnation, according as they possessed a marked
or indefinite character. They were generally described as
relatives, and always exactly in the same definite way.
Only subsequently, often several weeks later, after an
ecstasy, there would make its appearance a new complicated
romance which explained the striking relationship
through pre-existences or through illegitimate relations.
Persons sympathetic to S. W. were usually very near relatives.
Most of these family romances were very carefully
made up, so that to contradict them was impossible. They
were always worked out with a quite bewildering certainty,
and surprised one by an extremely clever evaluation of
certain details which she had noticed or taken from somewhere.
For the most part the romances had a ghastly
character, murder by poison and dagger, seduction and
divorce, forgery of wills, played the chief rôle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Mystic Science.</em>&mdash;In reference to scientific questions S. W.
put forward numerous suggestions. Generally towards the
end of the séances there was talk and debate about various
subjects of scientific and spiritistic nature. S. W. never took
part in the discussion, but generally sat dreamily in a
corner in a semi-somnambulic state. She listened to one
and another, taking hold of the talk in a half-dream, but she
could never relate anything connectedly; if asked about it
only partial explanations were given. In the course of the
winter hints emerged in various séances: "The spirits
taught her about the world-forces and the strange revelations
from the other side, yet she would not tell anything
now." Once she tried to give a description, but only said:
"On one side was the light, on the other the power of
attraction." Finally, in March 1900, when for some time
nothing had been heard of the teachings at the séances, she
announced suddenly with a joyful face that she had now
received everything from the spirits. She drew out a long
narrow strip of paper upon which were numerous names.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Although I asked for it she would not let it leave her hands,
but dictated the following scheme to me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_041.jpg"><img src="images/i_041sm.jpg" width="400" height="391" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>I can remember clearly that in the course of the winter
of 1895 we spoke several times in S. W.'s presence of the
forces of attraction and repulsion in connection with Kant's
"Natural History of the Heavens"; we spoke also of the
"Law of the Conservation of Energy," of the different forces
of energy, and of the question whether the force of gravity
was perhaps a form of movement. From this talk S. W. had
plainly created the foundation of her mystic system. She
gave the following explanation: The natural forces are
arranged in seven circles. Outside these circles are three
more, in which unknown forces intermediate between energy
and matter are found. Matter is found in seven circles
which surround ten inner ones. In the centre stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the primary force, which is the original cause of creation
and is a spiritual force. The first circle which
surrounds the primary force is matter which is not really
a force and does not arise from the primary force, but
it unites with the primary force and from this union the
first descendants are the spiritual forces; on the one hand
the Good or Light Powers, on the other the Dark Powers.
The Power Magnesor consists most of primary force; the
Power Connesor, in which the dark might of matter is
greatest, contains the least. The further outwards the
primary force streams forth, the weaker it becomes, but
weaker too becomes the power of matter, since its power is
greatest where the collision with the primary power is most
violent, <i>i.e.</i> in the Power Connesor. Within the circles there
are fresh analogous forces of equal strength but making in
the opposite direction. The system can also be described in
a single series beginning with primary force, Magnesor,
Cafor, etc., proceeding from left to right on the scheme and
ascending with Tusa, Endos, ending with Connesor; only
then the survey of the grade of intensity is made more
difficult. Every force in the outer circle is combined from
the nearest adjacent forces of the inner circle.</p>

<p>1. <em>The Magnesor Group.</em>&mdash;The so-called powers of Light
descend in direct line from Magnesor, but slightly influenced
by the dark side. The powers Magnesor and Cafor form
together the so-called Life Force, which is no single power
but is differently combined in animals and plants. Between
Magnesor and Cafor there exists the Life Force of Man.
Morally good men and those mediums who bring about
interviews of good spirits on the earth have most Magnesor.
Somewhere about the middle there stand the life forces of
animals, and in Cafor that of plants. Nothing is known about
Hefa, or rather S. W. can give no information. Persus is
the fundamental power which comes to light in the phenomenon
of the forces of locomotion. Its recognisable forces
are Warmth, Light, Electricity, Magnetism, and two unknown
forces, one of which only exists in comets. Of the
powers of the seventh circle S. W. could only point out north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and south magnetism and positive and negative electricity.
<em>Deka</em> is unknown. <em>Smar</em> is of peculiar significance, to be
indicated below; it leads to&mdash;</p>

<p>2. <em>Hypnos Group.</em>&mdash;<em>Hypnos</em> and <em>Hyfonismus</em> are powers
which only dwell within certain beings, in those who are
in a position to exert a magnetic influence upon others.
<em>Athialowi</em> is the sexual instinct. Chemical affinity is directly
derived from it. In the ninth circle under it arises indolence
(that is the line of Smar). <em>Svens</em> and <em>Kara</em> are of unknown
significance. <em>Pusa</em> corresponds to <em>Smar</em> in the opposite
sense.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Connesor Group.</em>&mdash;Connesor is the opposite pole of
Magnesor. It is the dark and wicked power equal in intensity
to the good power of light. While the good power creates,
this one turns into the opposite. Endos is an elemental power
of minerals. From these (significance unknown) gravitation
proceeds, which on its side is designated as the elemental
force of the forces of resistance that occur in phenomena
(gravity, capillarity, adhesion and cohesion). Nakus is the
secret power of a rare stone which controls the effect of snake
poison. The two powers <em>Smar</em> and <em>Pusa</em> have a special
importance. According to S. W., <em>Smar</em> develops in the bodies
of morally good men at the moment of death. This power
enables the soul to rise to the powers of light. Pusa behaves
in the opposite way, for it is the power which conducts
morally bad people to the dark side in the state of Connesor.</p>

<p>In the sixth circle the visible world begins, which only
appears to be so sharply divided from the other side in
consequence of the fickleness of our organs of sense. In
reality the transition is a very gradual one, and there are
people who live on a higher stage of knowledge because their
perceptions and sensations are more delicate than those of
others. Great seers are enabled to see manifestations of force
where ordinary people can perceive nothing. S. W. sees
Magnesor as a white or bluish vapour, which chiefly develops
when good spirits are near. Connesor is a dark vapour-like
fluid, which, like Magnesor, develops on the appearance of
"black" spirits. For instance, the night before the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of great visions the shiny vapour of Magnesor spreads in
thick layers, out of which, the good spirits grow to visible
white forces. It is just the same with Connesor. But these
powers have their different mediums. S. W. is a Magnesor
medium, as were the Prophetess of Prevorst and Swedenborg.
The materialisation mediums of the spiritualists are
mostly Connesor mediums, because materialisation takes
place much more easily through Connesor on account of its
close connection with the properties of matter. In the
summer of 1900 S. W. tried several times to produce the
circles of matter, but she never arrived at other than vague
and incomprehensible hints and afterwards spoke no more
about this.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion.</em>&mdash;The really interesting and valuable séances
came to an end with the production of the system of
powers. Before this a gradual decline in the vividness of
the ecstasies was noticeable. Ulrich von Gerbenstein came
increasingly to the front, and filled up the séances with his
childish chatter. The visions which S. W. had in the meantime
likewise seem to have lost vividness and plasticity
of formation, for S. W. was afterwards only able to feel
pleasant sensations in the presence of good spirits, and disagreeableness
in that of bad spirits. Nothing new was
produced. There was something of uncertainty in the trance
talks, as if feeling and seeking for the impression which she
was making upon the audience, together with an increasing
staleness in the content. In the outward behaviour of S. W.
there arose also a marked shyness and uncertainty, so that
the impression of wilful deception became ever stronger.
The writer therefore soon withdrew from the séances. S. W.
experimented afterwards in other circles, and six months
after my leaving was caught cheating <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in flagranti delicto</i>.
She wanted to arouse again by spiritualistic experiments the
lost belief in her supernatural powers; she concealed small
objects in her dress, throwing them up in the air during the
dark séance. With this her part was played out. Since then,
eighteen months have passed during which I have not seen
S. W. I have learnt from an observer who knew her in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
earlier days, that she has now and again strange states of
short duration during which she is very pale and silent, and
has a fixed glittering look. I did not hear any more of visions.
She is said not to take part any longer in spiritualistic séances.
S. W. is now in a large business, and according to all accounts
is an industrious and responsible person who does her work
eagerly and cleverly, giving entire satisfaction. According to
the account of trustworthy persons, her character has much
improved; she has become quieter, more regular and sympathetic.
No other abnormalities have appeared in her. This
case, in spite of its incompleteness, contains a mass of
psychological problems whose exposition goes far beyond
the limits of this little work. We must therefore be satisfied
with a mere sketch of the various striking manifestations.
For the sake of a more lucid exposition it seems better to
review the various states separately.</p>

<p>1. The <em>Waking State</em>.&mdash;Here the patient shows various
peculiarities. As we have seen, at school she was often distracted,
lost herself in a peculiar way, was moody; her behaviour
changes inconsequently, now quiet, shy, reserved, now
lively, noisy and talkative. She cannot be called unintelligent,
but she strikes one sometimes as narrow-minded, sometimes
as having isolated intelligent moments. Her memory
is good on the whole, but owing to her distraction it is much
impaired. Thus, despite much discussion and reading of
Kerner's "Seherin von Prevorst," for many weeks, she does not
know, if directly asked, whether the author's name is <em>Koerner</em>
or <em>Kerner</em>, nor the name of the Prophetess. All the same,
when it occasionally comes up, the name <em>Kerner</em> is correctly
written in the automatic communications. In general it
may be said that her character has something extremely
impulsive, incomprehensible, protean. Deducting the want
of balance due to puberty, there remains a pathological
residue which expresses itself in reactions which follow
no rule and a bizarre unaccountable character. This
character may be called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déséquilibré</i>, or unstable. Its specific
mould is derived from traits which can certainly be regarded
as hysterical. This is decidedly so in the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of distraction. As Janet<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> maintains, the foundation of
hysterical anæsthesia is the loss of attention. He was able
to prove in youthful hysterics "a striking indifference and
distracted attention in the whole region of the emotional
life." Misreading is a notable instance, which beautifully
illustrates hysterical dispersion of attention. The psychology
of this process may perhaps be viewed as follows:
during reading aloud attention becomes paralysed for this act
and is directed towards some other object. Meanwhile the
reading is continued mechanically, the sense impressions are
received as before, but in consequence of the dispersion the
excitability of the perceptive centre is lowered, so that the
strength of the sense impression is no longer adequate to
fix the attention in such a way that perception as such
is conducted along the motor speech route; thus all the
inflowing associations which at once unite with any new
sense impression are repressed. The further psychological
mechanism permits of only two possible explanations:
(1) The admission of the sense impression is received unconsciously
(because of the increase of threshold stimulus), in the
perceptive centre just below the threshold of consciousness,
and consequently is not incorporated in the attention and
conducted back to the speech route. It only reaches verbal
expression through the intervention of the nearest associations,
in our case through the dialect expression<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> for the object.
(2) The sense impression is perceived consciously, but at the
moment of its entrance into the speech route it reaches a
territory whose excitability is diminished by the dispersion
of attention. At this place the dialect word is substituted
by association for the motor speech image, and it is uttered
as such. In either case it is certain that it is the acoustic
dispersed attention which fails to correct the error. Which
of the two explanations is correct cannot be proved in
this case; probably both approach the truth, for the dispersion
of attention seems to be general, and in each
case concerns more than one of the centres engaged in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>act of reading aloud. In our case this phenomenon has a
special value, for we have here a quite elementary automatic
phenomenon. It may be called hysterical in so far as in this
concrete case a state of exhaustion and intoxication, with its
parallel manifestations, can be excluded. A healthy person
only exceptionally allows himself to be so engaged by an
object that he fails to correct the errors of a dispersed attention&mdash;those
of the kind described. The frequency of these
occurrences in the patient point to a considerable limitation
of the field of consciousness, in so far as she can only
master a relative minimum of elementary sensations flowing
in at the same time. If we wish to describe more exactly
the psychological state of the "psychic shady side," we
might call it either a sleeping or a dream-state, according
as passivity or activity predominated. There is, at all events,
a pathological dream-state of very rudimentary extension
and intensity and its genesis is spontaneous; dream-states
arising spontaneously, with the production of automatisms,
are generally regarded as hysterical on the whole. It
must be pointed out that these instances of misreading
occurred frequently in our subject, and that the term
hysterical is employed in this sense; so far as we know, it
is only on a foundation of hysterical constitution that spontaneous
states of partial sleep or dreams occur frequently.</p>

<p>Binet<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> has studied experimentally the automatic substitution
of some adjacent association in his hysterics. If
he pricked the anæsthetic hand of the patient without
his noticing the prick, he thought of "points"; if the
anæsthetic finger was moved, he thought of "sticks" or
"columns." When the anæsthetic hand, concealed from
the patient's sight by a screen, writes "Salpêtrière," she
sees in front of her the word "Salpêtrière" in white writing
on a black ground. This recalls the experiments above
referred to of Guinon and Sophie Waltke.</p>

<p>We thus find in our subject, at a time when there was
nothing to indicate the later phenomena, rudimentary automatisms,
fragments of dream manifestations, which imply in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
themselves the possibility that some day more than one
association would creep in between the perception of the dispersed
attention and consciousness. The misreading shows
us, moreover, a certain automatic independence of the
psychical elements. This occasionally expands to a more or
less fleeting dispersion of attention, although with very slight
results which are never in any way striking or suspicious;
this dispersedness approximates to that of the physiological
dream. The misreading can be thus conceived as a prodromal
symptom of the later events; especially as its
psychology is prototypical for the mechanism of somnambulic
dreams, which are indeed nothing but a many-sided
multiplication and manifold variation of the elementary processes
reviewed above. I never succeeded in demonstrating
during my observations similar rudimentary automatisms.
It would seem that in course of time the states of dispersed
attention, to a certain extent beneath the surface of consciousness,
at first of low degree have grown into these
remarkable somnambulic attacks; hence they disappeared
during the waking state, which was free from attacks. So
far as concerns the development of the patient's character,
beyond a certain not very extensive ripening, no remarkable
change could be demonstrated during the observations lasting
nearly two years. More remarkable is the fact that in the
two years since the cessation (complete?) of the somnambulic
attacks, a considerable change in character has taken place.
We shall have occasion later on to speak of the importance
of this observation.</p>

<p><em>Semi-Somnambulism.</em>&mdash;In S. W.'s case the following condition
was indicated by the term semi-somnambulism. For
some time after and before the actual somnambulic attack
the patient finds herself in a state whose most salient feature
can best be described as "preoccupation." She only lends
half an ear to the conversation around her, answers at
random, often gets absorbed in all manner of hallucinations;
her face is solemn, her look ecstatic, visionary, ardent.
Closer observation discloses a far-reaching alteration of the
entire character. She is now serious, dignified; when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
speaks her subject is always an extremely serious one. In
this condition she can talk so seriously, forcibly and convincingly,
that one is tempted to ask oneself if this is really
a girl of fifteen and a half. One has the impression of a
mature woman possessed of considerable dramatic talent.
The reason for this seriousness, this solemnity of behaviour,
is given in her explanation that at these times she stands at
the frontier of this world and the other, and associates just
as truly with the spirits of the dead as with living people.
And, indeed, her conversation is usually divided between
answers to real objective questions and hallucinatory ones.
I call this state semi-somnambulism because it coincides
with Richet's own definition. He<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> says: "La conscience
de cet individu persiste dans son intégrité apparente, toutefois
des opérations très compliquées vont s'accomplir en dehors
de la conscience sans que le moi volontaire et conscient
paraisse ressentir une modification quelconque. Une autre
personne sera en lui qui agira, pensera, voudra, sans que
la conscience, c'est à dire le moi réfléchi conscient, aît la
moindre notion."</p>

<p>Binet<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> says of this term: "Le terme indique la parenté
de cet état avec le somnambulisme véritable, et en suite il
laisse comprendre que la vie somnambulique qui se manifeste
durant la veille est réduite, déprimée, par la conscience
normale qui la recouvre."</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Automatisms.</span></p>

<p>Semi-somnambulism is characterised by the continuity
of consciousness with that of the waking state and by the
appearance of various automatisms which give evidence of
an activity of the subconscious self, independent of that
of consciousness.</p>

<p>Our case shows the following automatic phenomena:</p>

<blockquote><p>(1) Automatic movements of the table.</p>

<p>(2) Automatic writing.</p>

<p>(3) Hallucinations.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>1. <em>Automatic Movements of the Table.</em>&mdash;Before the patient
came under my observation she had been influenced by the
suggestion of "table-turning," which she had first come
across as a game. As soon as she entered the circle there
appeared communications from members of her family which
showed her to be a medium. I could only find out
that, as soon as ever her hand was placed on the table,
the typical movements began. The resulting communications
have no interest for us. But the automatic character
of the act itself deserves some discussion, for we may, without
more ado, set aside the imputation that there was any
question of intentional and voluntary pushing or pulling on
the part of the patient.</p>

<p>As we know from the investigations of Chevreul,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Gley,
Lehmann and others, unconscious motor phenomena are
not only of frequent occurrence among hysterical persons,
and those pathologically inclined in other directions, but
they are also relatively easily produced in normal persons
who show no other spontaneous automatisms. I have made
many experiments on these lines, and can confirm this
observation. In the great majority of instances all that is
required is enough patience to put up with an hour of quiet
waiting. In most subjects, motor automatisms will be obtained
in a more or less high degree if contra-suggestions
do not intervene as obstacles. In a relatively small percentage
the phenomena arise spontaneously, <i>i.e.</i> directly
under the influence of verbal suggestion or of some earlier
auto-suggestion. In this instance the case is powerfully
affected by suggestion. In general, the particular predisposition
is subject to all those laws which also hold good
for normal hypnosis. Nevertheless, certain special circumstances
are to be taken into account, conditioned by the
peculiarity of the case. It is not a question of a total
hypnosis, but of a partial one, limited entirely to the
motor area of the arm, like the cerebral anæsthesia produced
by "magnetic passes" for a painful spot in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
body. We touch the spot in question employing verbal
suggestion or making use of some existing auto-suggestion,
using the tactile stimulus which we know acts suggestively,
to bring about the desired partial hypnosis. In
accordance with this procedure, refractory subjects can
be brought easily enough to an exhibition of automatism.
The experimenter intentionally gives the table a slight push,
or, better, a series of rhythmic but very slight taps. After
a short time he notices that the oscillations become stronger,
that they continue although he has interrupted his own
intentional movements. The experiment has succeeded, the
subject has unsuspectingly taken up the suggestion. By
this procedure much more is obtained than by verbal suggestion.
In very receptive persons and in all those cases
where movement seems to arise spontaneously, the purposeful
tremulous movements,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> not perceptible by the subject,
assume the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> of <em>agent provocateur</em>.</p>

<p>In this way persons who, by themselves, have never obtained
automatic movements of a coarse calibre, sometimes
assume the unconscious guidance of the table-movements,
provided that the tremors are strong and that the medium
understands their meaning. In this case the medium takes
control of the slight oscillations and returns them considerably
strengthened, but rarely at exactly the same instant,
generally a few seconds later, in this way revealing the agent's
conscious or unconscious thought. By means of this simple
mechanism there may arise those cases of thought-reading
so bewildering at first sight. A very simple experiment,
that succeeds in many cases even with unpractised persons,
will serve to illustrate this. The experimenter thinks, say,
of the number <em>four</em>, and then waits, his hands quietly resting
on the table, until he feels that the table makes the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
inclination to announce the number thought of. He lifts his
hands off the table immediately, and the number <em>four</em> will
be correctly tilted out. It is advisable in this experiment
to place the table upon a soft thick carpet. By close
attention the experimenter will occasionally notice a movement
of the table which is thus represented.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="500" height="304" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></p></div>
</div>

<blockquote><p>(1) Purposeful tremors too slight to be perceived by
the subject.</p>

<p>(2) Several very small but perceptible oscillations of
the table which indicate that the subject is responding
to them.</p>

<p>(3) The big movements (tilts) of the table, giving the
number four that was thought of.</p>

<p>(<i>ab</i>) Denotes the moment when the operator's hands
are removed.</p></blockquote>

<p>This experiment succeeds excellently with well-disposed
but inexperienced subjects. After a little practice the
phenomenon indicated is wont to disappear, since by practice
the number is read and reproduced directly from the purposeful
movements.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In a responsive medium these purposeful tremors of the
experimenter act just as the intentional taps in the experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
cited above; they are received, strengthened and reproduced,
although slightly wavering. Still they are perceptible and
hence act suggestively as slight tactile stimuli, and by the
increase of partial hypnosis give rise to great automatic
movements. This experiment illustrates in the clearest way
the increase step by step of auto-suggestion. Along the path
of this auto-suggestion are developed all the automatic
phenomena of a motor nature. How the intellectual content
gradually mingles in with the purely motor need scarcely be
elucidated after this discussion. There is no need of a special
suggestion for the evoking of intellectual phenomena. From
the outset it is a question of word-presentation, at least from
the side of the experimenter. After the first aimless motor
irrelevancies of the unpractised subject, some word-products
or the intentions of the experimenter are soon reproduced.
Objectively the occurrence of an intellectual content must be
understood as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>By the gradual increase of auto-suggestion the motor-range
of the arm becomes isolated from consciousness, that
is to say, the perception of the slight movement-impulse is
concealed from consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>By the knowledge gained from consciousness that some
intellectual content is possible, there results a collateral
excitation in the speech-area as the means immediately at
hand for intellectual notification. The motor part of word-presentation
is necessarily chiefly concerned with this aiming
at notification.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In this way we understand the unconscious
flowing over of speech-impulse to the motor-area<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and conversely
the gradual penetration of partial hypnosis into the
speech-area.</p>

<p>In numerous experiments with beginners, as a rule I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
observed at the beginning of intellectual phenomena a relatively
large number of completely meaningless words, also
often a series of meaningless single letters. Later on, all
kinds of absurdities are produced, <i>e.g.</i> words or entire
sentences with the letters irregularly misplaced or with the
order of the letters all reversed&mdash;a kind of mirror-writing.
The appearance of the letter or word indicates a new
suggestion; some sort of association is involuntarily joined
to it, which is then realised. Remarkably enough, these are
not generally the conscious associations, but quite unexpected
ones, a circumstance showing that a considerable part of
the speech-area is already hypnotically isolated. The recognition
of this automatism again forms a fruitful suggestion,
since invariably at this moment the feeling of strangeness
arises, if it is not already present in the pure motor-automatism.
The question, "Who is doing this?" "Who is speaking?",
is the suggestion for the synthesis of the unconscious
personality which as a rule does not like being kept waiting
too long. Any name is introduced, generally one charged
with emotion, and the automatic splitting of the personality
is accomplished. How accidental and how vacillating
this synthesis is at its beginning, the following reports from
the literature show. Myers<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> communicates the following
interesting observation on a Mr. A., a member of the
Society for Psychical Research, who was making experiments
on himself in automatic writing.</p>


<blockquote><p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Third Day.</span></p>

<p>Question: What is man?</p>

<p>Answer: TEFI H HASL ESBLE LIES.</p>

<p>Is that an anagram? Yes.</p>

<p>How many words does it contain? Five.</p>

<p>What is the first word? SEE.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>What is the second word? SEEEE.</p>

<p>See? Shall I interpret it myself? Try to.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. A. found this solution: "Life is less able." He was
astonished at this intellectual information, which seemed to
him to prove the existence of an intelligence independent of
his own. Therefore he went on to ask:</p>

<blockquote><p>Who are you? Clelia.</p>

<p>Are you a woman? Yes.</p>

<p>Have you ever lived upon the earth? No.</p>

<p>Will you come to life? Yes.</p>

<p>When? In six years.</p>

<p>Why are you conversing with me? E if Clelia el.</p>

<p>Mr. A. interpreted this answer as: I Clelia feel.</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Fourth Day.</span></p>

<p>Question: Am I the one who asks the questions? Yes.</p>

<p>Is Clelia there? No.</p>

<p>Who is here then? Nobody.</p>

<p>Does Clelia exist at all? No.</p>

<p>With whom then was I speaking yesterday? With
no one.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Janet<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> conducted the following conversation with the
subconsciousness of Lucie, who, meanwhile, was engaged
in conversation with another observer. "M'entendez-vous?"
asks Janet. Lucie answers by automatic writing, "Non."
"Mais pour répondre il faut entendre?" "Oui, absolument."
"Alors comment faites-vous?" "Je ne sais." "Il faut
bien qu'il y ait quelqu'un qui m'entend?" "Oui." "Qui
cela! Autre que Lucie. Eh bien! Une autre personne.
Voulez-vous que nous lui donnions un nom?" "Non." "Si,
ce sera plus commode," "Eh bien, Adrienne!" "Alors,
Adrienne, m'entendez-vous?" "Oui."</p>

<p>From these quotations it will be seen in what way the
subconscious personality is constructed. It owes its origin
purely to suggestive questions meeting a certain disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of the medium. The explanation is the result of the
disintegration of the psychical complex; the feeling of the
strangeness of such automatisms then comes in to help, as
soon as conscious attention is directed to the automatic act.
Binet<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> remarks on this experiment of Janet's: "Il faut bien
remarquer que si la personnalité d'Adrienne a pu se créer, c'est
qu'elle a rencontré une possibilité psychologique; en d'autres
termes, il y avait là des phénomènes désagrégés vivant séparés
de la conscience normale du sujet." The individualisation
of the subconsciousness always denotes a considerable further
step of great suggestive influence upon the further formation
of automatisms.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> So, too, we must regard the origin of the
unconscious personalities in our case.</p>

<p>The objection that there is simulation in automatic table-turning
may well be given up, when one considers the
phenomenon of thought-reading from the purposeful tremors
which the patient offered in such plenitude. Rapid, conscious
thought-reading demands at the least an extraordinary
degree of practice, which it has been shown the patient did
not possess. By means of the purposeful tremors whole
conversations can be carried on, as in our case. In the
same way the suggestibility of the subconscious can be
proved objectively if, for instance, the experimenter with his
hand on the table desires that the hand of the medium should
no longer be able to move the table or the glass; contrary to
all expectation and to the liveliest astonishment of the
subject, the table will immediately remain immovable.
Naturally any other desired suggestions can be realised,
provided they do not overstep by their innervations the
region of partial hypnosis; this proves at the same time
the limited nature of the hypnosis. Suggestions for the
legs and the other arm will thus not be obeyed. Table-turning
was not an automatism which belonged exclusively
to the patient's semi-somnambulism: on the contrary, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>occurred in the most pronounced form in the waking state,
and in most cases then passed over into semi-somnambulism,
the appearance of this being generally announced
by hallucinations, as it was at the first sitting.</p>

<p>2. <em>Automatic Writing.</em>&mdash;A second automatic phenomenon,
which at the outset corresponds to a higher degree of partial
hypnosis, is automatic writing. It is, according to my experience,
much rarer and more difficult to produce than table-turning.
As in table-turning, it is again a matter of a primary
suggestion, to the conscious when sensibility is retained, to
the unconscious when it is obliterated. The suggestion is,
however, not a simple one, for it already bears in itself an
intellectual element. "To write" means "to write something."
This special element of the suggestion, which
extends beyond the merely motor, often conditions a certain
perplexity on the part of the subject, giving rise to slight
contrary suggestions which hinder the appearance of the
automatisms. I have observed in a few cases that the suggestion
is realised, despite its relative venturesomeness (<i>e.g.</i>
one directed towards the waking consciousness of a so-called
normal person). However, it takes place in a peculiar way;
it first displaces the purely motor part of the central system
concerned in hypnosis, and the deeper hypnosis is then
reached by auto-suggestion from the motor phenomenon,
analogous to the procedure in table-turning described above.
The subject,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> who has a pencil in his hand, is purposely
engaged in conversation whilst his attention is diverted from
the writing. The hand begins to make movements, beginning
with many upward strokes and zigzag lines, or a
simple line is made. Occasionally it happens that the pencil
does not touch the paper, but writes in the air. These movements
must be conceived as purely motor phenomena, which
correspond to the expression of the motor element in the
presentation "write." This phenomenon is somewhat rare;
generally single letters are first written, and what was said
above of table-turning holds true of their combination into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
words and sentences. True mirror-writing is also observed
here and there. In the majority of cases, and perhaps
in all experiments with beginners who are not under
some very special suggestion, the automatic writing is that
of the subject. Occasionally its character may be greatly
changed,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but this is secondary, and is always to be regarded
as a symptom of the intruding synthesis of a subconscious
personality.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="500" height="153" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>As stated, the patient's automatic writing never came to
any very great development. In these experiments, generally
carried out in darkness, she passed over into semi-somnambulism,
or into ecstasy. The automatic writing had thus the
same effect as the preliminary table-turning.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Hallucinations.</em>&mdash;The nature of the passing into
somnambulism in the second séance is of psychological
importance. As stated, the automatic phenomena were progressing
favourably when darkness came on. The most
interesting event of this séance, so far, was the brusque
interruption of the communication from the grandfather,
which was the starting-point of various debates amongst the
members of the circle. These two momentous occurrences,
the darkness and the striking event, seem to have been the
foundation for a rapid deepening of hypnosis, in consequence
of which the hallucinations could be developed. The psychological
mechanism of this process seems to be as follows.
The influence of darkness upon the suggestibility of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sense-organs is well known.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Binet<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> states that it has a
special influence on hysterics, producing a state of sleepiness.
As is clear from the foregoing, the patient was in a state
of partial hypnosis and had constituted herself one with
the unconscious personality in closest relationship to her in
the domain of speech. The automatic expression of this
personality is interrupted most unexpectedly by a new person,
of whose existence no one had any suspicion. Whence
came this cleavage? Obviously the eager expectation of
this first séance had very much occupied the patient. Her
reminiscences of me and my family had probably grouped
themselves around this expectation; hence these suddenly
come to light at the climax of the automatic expression.
That it was just my grandfather and no one else&mdash;not, <i>e.g.</i>,
my deceased father, who, as she knew, was much closer to
me than the grandfather whom I had never known&mdash;perhaps
suggests where the origin of this new person is to be sought.
It is probably a dissociation of the personality already present
which seized upon the material next at hand for its expression,
namely, upon the associations concerning myself. How
far this is parallel to the experiences revealed by dream
investigation (Freud's<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>) must remain undecided, for we have
no means of judging how far the effect mentioned can be
considered a "repressed" one. From the brusque interruption
of the new personality, we may conclude that the
presentations concerned were very vivid, with corresponding
intensity of expectation. This perhaps was an attempt to
overcome a certain maidenly shyness and embarrassment.
This event reminds us vividly of the manner in which the
dream presents to consciousness, by a more or less transparent
symbolism, things one has never said to oneself
clearly and openly. We do not know when this dissociation
of the new personality occurred, whether it had been slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>prepared in the unconscious, or whether it first occurred in
the séance. In any case, this event meant a considerable
increase in the extension of the unconscious sphere rendered
accessible through the hypnosis. At the same time this
event must be regarded as powerfully suggestive in regard
to the impression which it made upon the waking consciousness
of the patient. For the perception of this unexpected
intervention of a new power must inevitably excite a feeling
of the strangeness of the automatisms, and would easily
suggest the thought that an independent spirit is here making
itself known. Hence the intelligible association that she
would finally be able to see this spirit. The situation that
ensued at the second séance is to be explained by the coincidence
of this energising suggestion with the heightened
suggestibility conditioned by the darkness. The hypnosis, and
with it the series of dissociated presentations, break through
to the visual area, and the expression of the unconscious,
hitherto purely motor, is made objective, according to the
measure of the specific energy of the new system, in the
shape of visual images with the character of hallucinations;
not as a mere accompanying phenomenon of the word-automatism,
but as a substituted function. The explanation of
the situation that arose in the first séance, at that time unexpected
and inexplicable, is no longer presented in words,
but as a descriptive allegorical vision. The sentence "they
do not hate one another, but are friends," is expressed
in a picture. We often encounter events of this kind in
somnambulism. The thinking of somnambulists is given in
plastic images which constantly break into this or that
sense-sphere and are made objective in hallucinations. The
process of reflection sinks into the subconscious; only its
end-results arise to consciousness either as presentations
vividly tinged by the senses, or directly as hallucinations. In
our case the same thing occurred as in the patient whose
anæsthetic hand Binet pricked nine times, making her
think of the figure 9; or as in Flournoy's<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Helen Smith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
who, when asked during business-hours about certain patterns,
suddenly saw the number of days (18) for which they had
been lent, at a length of 20 mm. in front of her. The
further question arises, why does the automatism appear in
the visual and not in the acoustic sphere? There are several
grounds for this choice of the visual sphere.</p>

<p>(1) The patient is not gifted acoustically; she is, for
instance, very unmusical.</p>

<p>(2) There was no stillness corresponding to the darkness
which might have favoured the appearance of sounds; there
was a lively conversation.</p>

<p>(3) The increased conviction of the near presence of
spirits, because the automatism felt so strange, could easily
have aroused the idea that a spirit might be seen, thus
causing a slight excitation of the visual sphere.</p>

<p>(4) The entoptic phenomena in darkness favoured the
occurrence of hallucinations.</p>

<p>The reasons (3) and (4)&mdash;the entoptic phenomena in the
darkness and the probable excitation of the visual sphere&mdash;are
of decisive importance for the appearance of hallucinations.
The entoptic phenomena in this case play the same rôle in
the auto-suggestion, the production of the automatism, as the
slight tactile stimuli in hypnosis of the motor centre. As
stated, flashes preceded the first hallucinatory twilight-state.
Obviously attention was already at a high pitch, and directed
to visual perceptions, so that the retina's own light, usually
very weak, was seen with great intensity. The part played
by entoptic perceptions of light in the origin of hallucinations
deserves further consideration. Schüle<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> says: "The swarming
of light and colour which stimulates and animates the
field of vision, although in the dark, supplies the material for
phantastic figures in the air before falling asleep. As we
know, absolute darkness is never seen; a few particles of
the dark field of vision are always illumined; flecks of light
move here and there, and combine into all kinds of figures;
it only needs a moderately active imagination to create<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
out of them, as one does out of clouds, certain known
figures. The power of reasoning, fading as one falls asleep,
leaves phantasy free play to construct very vivid figures.
In the place of the light spots, haziness and changing
colours of the dark visual field, there arise definite outlines of
objects."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>In this way hypnagogic hallucinations arise. The chief
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> naturally belongs to the imagination, hence imaginative
people in particular are subject to hypnagogic hallucinations.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
The hypnopompic hallucinations described by Myers arise in
the same way.</p>

<p>It is highly probable that hypnagogic pictures are identical
with the dream-pictures of normal sleep&mdash;forming their
visual foundation. Maury<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> has proved from self-observation
that the pictures which hovered around him hypnagogically
were also the objects of the dreams that followed. G. Trumbull
Ladd<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> has shown this even more convincingly. By
practice he succeeded in waking himself suddenly two to
five minutes after falling asleep. He then observed that the
figures dancing before the retina at times represented the
same contours as the pictures just dreamed of. He even
states that nearly every visual dream is shaped by the retina's
own light-figures. In our case the fantastic rendering
of these pictures was favoured by the situation. We must
not underrate the influence of the over-excited expectation
which allowed the dull retina-light to appear with
increased intensity.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The further formation of the retinal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>appearances follows in accordance with the predominating
presentations. That hallucinations appear in this way has
been also observed in other visionaries. Jeanne d'Arc<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> first saw
a cloud of light, and only after some time there stepped forth
St. Michael, St. Catherine and St. Margaret. For a whole
hour Swedenborg<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> saw nothing but illuminated spheres and
fiery flames. He felt a mighty change in the brain, which
seemed to him "release of light." After the space of one
hour he suddenly saw red figures which he regarded as
angels and spirits. The sun visions of Benvenuto Cellini<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
in Engelsburg are probably of the same nature. A student
who frequently saw apparitions stated: "When these apparitions
come, at first I only see single masses of light and
at the same time am conscious of a dull noise in the ears.
Gradually these contours become clear figures."</p>

<p>The appearance of hallucinations occurred in a quite
classical way in Flournoy's Helen Smith. I quote the
cases in question from his article.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>"18 Mars. Tentative d'expérience dans l'obscurité. Mlle.
Smith voit un ballon tantôt luminieux, tantôt s'obscurcissant.</p>

<p>"25 Mars. Mlle. Smith commence à distinguer de vagues
lueurs, de longs rubans blancs, s'agitant du plancher au
plafond, puis enfin une magnifique étoile qui dans l'obscurité
s'est montrée à elle seule pendant toute la séance.</p>

<p>"1 Avril. Mlle. Smith se sent très agitée, elle a des
frissons, est partiellement glacée. Elle est très inquiète et
voit tout à coup se balançant au-dessus de la table une figure
grimaçante et très laide avec de longs cheveux rouges.
Elle voit alors un magnifique bouquet de roses de nuances
diverses; tout à coup elle voit sortir de dessous le bouquet
un petit serpent, qui, rampant doucement, vient sentir les
fleurs, les regarde," etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen Smith<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> says in regard to the origin of her vision
of March:</p>

<p>"La lueur rouge persista autour de moi et je me suis
trouvée entourée de fleurs extraordinaires."</p>

<p>At all times the complex hallucinations of visionaries
have occupied a peculiar place in scientific criticism. Macario<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
early separated these so-called intuition-hallucinations from
others, since he maintains that they occur in persons of
an eager mind, deep understanding and high nervous excitability.
Hecker<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> expresses himself similarly but more
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>His view is that their condition is "the congenital high
development of the spiritual organ which calls into active,
free and mobile play the life of the imagination, bringing it
spontaneous activity." These hallucinations are "precursors
or signs of mighty spiritual power." The vision is "an
increased excitation which is harmoniously adapted to the
most complete health of mind and body." The complex
hallucinations do not belong to the waking state, but prefer
as a rule a partial waking state. The visionary is buried
in his vision even to complete annihilation. Flournoy was
also always able to prove in the visions of H.S. "un certain
degré d'obnubilation." In our case the vision is complicated
by a state of sleep whose peculiarities we shall review later.</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">The Change in Character.</span></p>

<p>The most striking characteristic of the second stage in
our case is the change in character. We meet many cases
in the literature which have offered the symptom of
spontaneous character-change. The first case in a scientific
publication is Weir-Mitchell's<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> case of Mary Reynolds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the case of a young woman living in Pennsylvania
in 1811. After a deep sleep of about twenty hours she
had totally forgotten her entire past and everything she
had learnt; even the words she spoke had lost their
meaning. She no longer knew her relatives. Slowly she
re-learnt to read and write, but her writing was from
right to left. More striking still was the change in her
character. Instead of being melancholy, she was now
cheerful in the extreme. Instead of being reserved, she
was buoyant and sociable. Formerly taciturn and retiring,
she was now merry and jocose. Her disposition was totally
changed.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>In this state she renounced her former retired life and
liked to undertake adventurous excursions unarmed, through
wood and mountain, on foot and horseback. In one of these
excursions she encountered a large black bear, which she took
for a pig. The bear raised himself on his hind legs and
gnashed his teeth at her. As she could not drive her horse
on any further, she took an ordinary stick and hit the bear
until it took to flight. Five weeks later, after a deep sleep,
she returned to her earlier state with amnesia for the interval.
These states alternated for about sixteen years. <em>But her last
twenty-five years Mary Reynolds passed exclusively in her second
state.</em></p>

<p>Schroeder von der Kalk<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> reports on the following case:
The patient became ill at the age of sixteen with periodic
amnesia, after a previous tedious illness of three years.
Sometimes in the morning after waking she passed through
a peculiar choreic state, during which she made rhythmical
movements with her arms. Throughout the whole day she
would then exhibit a childish, silly behaviour and lost all
her educated capabilities. (When normal she is very intelligent,
well-read, speaks French well.) In the second state
she begins to speak faulty French. On the second day she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is again at times normal. The two states are completely
separated by amnesia.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Hoefelt<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> reports on a case of spontaneous somnambulism
in a girl who, in her normal state, was submissive and modest,
but in somnambulism was impertinent, rude and violent.
Azam's<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Felida was, in her normal state, depressed, inhibited,
timid; and in the second state lively, confident, enterprising
to recklessness. <em>The second state gradually became the chief
one, and finally so far suppressed the first state that the patient
called her normal states, lasting now but a short time, "crises."</em>
The amnesic attacks had begun at 14&frac12;. In time the
second state became milder and there was a certain approximation
between the character of the two states. A very
striking example of change in character is that worked out
by Camuset, Ribot, Legrand du Saulle, Richer, Voisin, and
put together by Bourru and Burot.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It is that of Louis V.,
a severe male hysteric with amnesic alternating character.
In the first stage he is rude, cheeky, querulous, greedy,
thievish, inconsiderate. In the second state he is an
agreeable, sympathetic character, industrious, docile and
obedient. This amnesic change of character has been used
by Paul Lindau<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> in his drama "Der Andere" (The Other
One).</p>

<p>Rieger<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> reports on a case parallel to Lindau's criminal
lawyer. The unconscious personalities of Janet's Lucie and
Léonie (Janet, <i>l.c.</i>) and Morton Prince's<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> may also be regarded
as parallel with our case. There are, however,
therapeutic artificial products whose importance lies in the
domain of the dissociation of consciousness and of memory.</p>

<p>In the above cases, the second state is always separated
from the first by an amnesic dissociation, and the change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>in character is, at times, accompanied by a break in
the continuity of consciousness. In our case there is no
amnesic disturbance; the passage from the first to the second
stage follows quite gradually and the continuity of consciousness
remains. The patient carries out in her waking state
everything, otherwise unknown to her, from the field of the
unconscious that she has experienced during hallucinations
in the second stage.</p>

<p>Periodic changes in personality without amnesic dissociation
are found in the region of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">folie circulaire</i>, but are rarely
seen in hysterics, as Renaudin's<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> case shows. A young man,
whose behaviour had always been excellent, suddenly began
to display the worst tendencies. There were no symptoms of
insanity, but, on the other hand, the whole surface of the
body was anæsthetic. This state showed periodic intervals,
and in the same way the patient's character was subject
to vacillations. As soon as the anæsthesia disappeared
he was manageable and friendly. When the
anæsthesia returned he was overcome by the worst instincts,
which, it was observed, even included the wish to
murder.</p>

<p>Remembering that our patient's age at the beginning of
the disturbances was 14-1/2, that is, the age of puberty had
just been reached, one must suppose that there was some
connection between the disturbances and the physiological
character-changes at puberty. "There appears in the consciousness
of the individual during this period of life a new
group of sensations, together with the feelings and ideas
arising therefrom; this continuous pressure of unaccustomed
mental states makes itself constantly felt because the cause
is always at work; the states are co-ordinated because they
arise from one and the same source, and must little by
little bring about deep-seated changes in the ego."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Vacillating
moods are easily recognisable; the confused new,
strong feelings, the inclination towards idealism, to exalted
religiosity and mysticism, side by side with the falling back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
into childishness, all this gives to adolescence its prevailing
character. At this epoch the human being first makes
clumsy attempts at independence in every direction; for
the first time uses for his own purposes all that family
and school have contributed hitherto; he conceives ideals,
constructs far-reaching plans for the future, lives in dreams
whose content is ambitious and egotistic. This is all physiological.
The puberty of a psychopathic is a crisis of more
serious import. Not only do the psychophysical changes
run a stormy course, but features of a hereditary degenerate
character become fixed. In the child these do not
appear at all, or but sporadically. For the explanation
of our case we are bound to consider a specific disturbance
of puberty. The reasons for this view will appear from
a further study of the second personality. (For the sake
of brevity we shall call the second personality <span class="smcap">Ivenes</span>&mdash;as
the patient baptised her higher ego).</p>

<p>Ivenes is the exact continuation of the everyday ego.
She includes the whole of her conscious content. In the semi-somnambulic
state her intercourse with the real external world
is analogous to that of the waking state, that is, she is influenced
by recurrent hallucinations, but no more than persons
who are subject to non-confusional psychotic hallucinations.
The continuity of Ivenes obviously extends to the hysterical
attack with its dramatic scenes, visionary events, etc. During
the attack itself she is generally isolated from the external
world; she does not notice what is going on around her,
does not know that she is talking loudly, etc. But she has
no amnesia for the dream-content of her attack. Amnesia
for her motor expressions and for the changes in her surroundings
is not always present. That this is dependent upon
the degree of intensity of her somnambulic state and that
there is sometimes partial paralysis of individual sense organs
is proved by the occasion when she did not notice me; her
eyes were then open, and most probably she saw the others,
although she only perceived me when I spoke to her. This
is a case of so-called <em>systematised anæsthesia</em> (negative hallucination)
which is often observed in hysterics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Flournoy,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> for instance, reports of Helen Smith that
during the séances she suddenly ceased to see those taking
part, although she still heard their voices and felt their
touch; sometimes she no longer heard, although she saw the
movements of the lips of the speakers, etc.</p>

<p>Ivenes is just the continuation of the waking self. She
contains the entire consciousness of S. W.'s waking state.
Her remarkable behaviour tells decidedly against any analogy
with cases of <em>double consciousness</em>. The characteristics of
Ivenes contrast favourably with the patient's ordinary self.
She is a calmer, more composed personality; her pleasing
modesty and accuracy, her uniform intelligence, her confident
way of talking must be regarded as an improvement
of the whole being; thus far there is analogy with Janet's
Léonie. But this is the extent of the similarity. Apart
from the amnesia, they are divided by a deep psychological
difference. Léonie II. is the healthier, the more normal; she
has regained her natural capabilities, she shows remarkable
improvement upon her chronic condition of hysteria. Ivenes
rather gives the impression of a more artificial product; there
is something thought out; despite all her excellences she
gives the impression of playing a part excellently; her world-sorrow,
her yearning for the other side of things, are not
merely piety but the attributes of saintliness. Ivenes is no
mere human, but a mystic being who only partly belongs to
reality. The mournful features, the attachment to sorrow,
her mysterious fate, lead us to the historic prototype of Ivenes&mdash;Justinus
Kerner's "Prophetess of Prevorst." Kerner's
book must be taken as known, and therefore I omit any
references to these common traits. But Ivenes is no copy of
the prophetess; she lacks the resignation and the saintly
piety of the latter. The prophetess is merely used by her as
a study for her own original conception. The patient pours
her own soul into the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> of the prophetess, thus seeking to
create an ideal of virtue and perfection. She anticipates
her future. She incarnates in Ivenes what she wishes to
be in twenty years&mdash;the assured, influential, wise, gracious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
pious lady. It is in the construction of the second person
that there lies the far-reaching difference between Léonie II.
and Ivenes. Both are psychogenic. But Léonie I. receives
in Léonie II. what really belongs to her, while S. W. builds
up a person beyond herself. It cannot be said "she deceives
herself" into, but that "she dreams herself" into
the higher ideal state.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The realisation of this dream recalls vividly the psychology
of the pathological cheat. Delbruck<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and Forel<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> have indicated
the importance of auto-suggestion in the formation of
pathological cheating and reverie. Pick<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> regards intense auto-suggestibility
as the first symptom of the hysterical dreamer,
making possible the realisation of the "day-dream." One
of Pick's patients dreamt that she was in a morally dangerous
situation, and finally carried out an attempt at rape on herself;
she lay on the floor naked and fastened herself to a table and
chairs. Or some dramatic person will be created with whom
the patient enters into correspondence by letter, as in Bohn's
case.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The patient dreamt herself into an engagement with
a totally imaginary lawyer in Nice, from whom she received
letters which she had herself written in disguised handwriting.
This pathological dreaming, with auto-suggestive
deceptions of memory amounting to real delusions and
hallucinations, is pre-eminently to be found in the lives of
many saints.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>It is only a step from the dreamlike images strongly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>stamped by the senses to the true complex hallucinations.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
In Pick's case, for instance, one sees that the patient, who
persuades herself that she is the Empress Elizabeth, gradually
loses herself in her dreams to such an extent that her condition
must be regarded as a true "twilight" state. Later
it passes over into hysterical delirium, when her dream-phantasies
become typical hallucinations. The pathological
liar, who becomes involved through his phantasies, behaves
exactly like a child who loses himself in his play, or like the
actor who loses himself in his part.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> There is here no
fundamental distinction from somnambulic dissociation of
personality, but only a difference of degree, which rests upon
the intensity of the primary auto-suggestibility or disintegration
of the psychic elements. <em>The more consciousness becomes
dissociated, the greater becomes the plasticity of the dream
situation, the less becomes the amount of conscious lying and of
consciousness in general.</em> This being carried away by interest
in the object is what Freud calls <em>hysterical identification</em>. For
instance, to Erler's<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> acutely hysterical patient there appeared
hypnagogically little riders made of paper, who so took
possession of her imagination that she had the feeling of
being herself one of them. Similar phenomena normally
occur to us in dreams in general, in which we think like
"hysterics."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The complete abandonment to the interesting image
explains also the wonderful naturalness of pseudological
or somnambulic representation&mdash;a degree unattainable in
conscious acting. The less waking consciousness intervenes
by reflection and reasoning, the more certain and convincing
becomes the objectivation of the dream, e.g. the roof-climbing
of somnambulists.</p>

<p>Our case has another analogy with <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pseudologia phantastica</i>:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span><em>The development of the phantasies during the attacks.</em> Many
cases are known in the literature where the pathological
lying comes on in attacks and during serious hysterical
trouble.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Our patient develops her systems exclusively in the attack.
In her normal state she is quite incapable of giving any new
ideas or explanations; she must either transpose herself into
somnambulism or await its spontaneous appearance. This
exhausts the affinity to <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pseudologia phantastica</i> and to pathological
dream-states.</p>

<p>Our patient's state is even differentiated from pathological
dreaming, since it could never be proved that her dream-weavings
had at any time previously been the objects of her
interest during the day. Her dreams occur explosively,
break forth with bewildering completeness from the darkness
of the unconscious. Exactly the same was the case in
Flournoy's Helen Smith. In many cases (see below), however,
links with the perceptions of the normal states can be
demonstrated: it seems therefore probable that the roots
of every dream were originally images with an emotional
accentuation, which, however, only occupied waking consciousness
for a short time.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> We must allow that in the origin of
such dreams hysterical forgetfulness<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> plays a <em>part not to be
underestimated</em>.</p>

<p>Many images are buried which would be sufficient to
put the consciousness on guard; associated classes of ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
are lost and go on spinning their web in the unconscious,
thanks to the psychic dissociation; this is a process which we
meet again in the genesis of our dreams.</p>

<p>"Our conscious reflection teaches us that when exercising
attention we pursue a definite course. But if that course
leads us to an idea which does not meet with our approval,
we discontinue and cease to apply our attention. Now,
apparently, the chain of thought thus started and abandoned,
may go on without regaining attention unless it reaches
a spot of especially marked intensity, which compels renewed
attention. An initial rejection, perhaps consciously brought
about by the judgment on the ground of incorrectness or
unfitness for the actual purpose of the mental act, may
therefore account for the fact that a mental process continues
unnoticed by consciousness until the onset of sleep."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>In this way we may explain the apparently sudden and
direct appearance of dream-states. The entire carrying
over of the conscious personality into the dream-<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> involves
indirectly the development of simultaneous automatisms.
"Une seconde condition peut amener la division de conscience;
ce n'est pas une altération de la sensibilité, c'est une attitude
particulière de l'esprit, la concentration de l'attention pour
un point unique; il résulte de cet état de concentration que
l'esprit devient distrait pour la reste et en quelque sorte
insensible, ce qui ouvre la carrière aux actions automatiques,
et ces actions peuvent prendre un caractère psychique et
constituer des intelligences parasites, vivant côte à côte avec
la personnalité normale qui ne les connaît pas."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Our subject's romances throw a most significant light on
the subjective roots of her dreams. They swarm with secret
and open love-affairs, with illegitimate births and other
sexual insinuations. The central point of all these ambiguous
stories is a lady whom she dislikes, who is gradually made to
assume the form of her polar opposite, and whilst Ivenes
becomes the pinnacle of virtue, this lady is a sink of iniquity.
<em>But her reincarnation doctrines, in which she appears as the</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
<em>mother of countless thousands, arises in its naïve nakedness from
an exuberant phantasy which is, of course, very characteristic
of the period of puberty. It is the woman's premonition of the
sexual feeling, the dream of fruitfulness, which the patient has
turned into these monstrous ideas.</em> We shall not go wrong if
we seek for the curious form of the disease in the teeming
sexuality of this too-rich soil. Viewed from this standpoint,
the whole creation of Ivenes, with her enormous family, is
nothing but a dream of sexual wish-fulfilment, differentiated
from the dream of a night only in that it persists for
months and years.</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Relation to the Hysterical Attack.</span></p>

<p>So far one point in S. W.'s history has remained unexplained,
and that is her attack. In the second séance she
was suddenly seized with a sort of fainting fit, from which
she awoke with a recollection of various hallucinations.
According to her own statement, she had not lost consciousness
for a moment. Judging from the external symptoms
and the course of the attack, one is inclined to regard it as
a <em>narcolepsy</em>, or rather a <em>lethargy</em>; such, for example, as
Loewenfeld has described, and the more readily as we know
that previously one member of her family (her grandmother)
has had an attack of lethargy. It is possible to imagine that
the <em>lethargic disposition</em> (Loewenfeld) had descended to our
subject. In spiritualistic séances it is not usual to see
hysterical convulsions. Our subject showed no sort of convulsive
symptoms, but in their place, perhaps, the peculiar
sleeping-states. Ætiologically, at the outset, two moments
must be taken into consideration:</p>

<p>1. The irruption of hypnosis.</p>

<p>2. The psychic stimulation.</p>

<p>1. <em>Irruption of Partial Hypnosis.</em>&mdash;Janet observes that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
subconscious automatisms have a hypnotic influence and
can bring about complete somnambulism.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>He made the following experiment: While the patient,
who was in the completely waking state, was engaged in
conversation by a second observer, Janet stationed himself
behind her and by means of whispered suggestions made her
unconsciously move her hand and by written signs give an
answer to questions. Suddenly the patient broke off the
conversation, turned round and with her supraliminal consciousness
continued the previously subconscious talk with
Janet. She had fallen into hypnotic somnambulism.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>There is here a state of affairs similar to our patient's.
But it must be noted that, for certain reasons discussed later,
the sleeping state is not to be regarded as hypnotic. We
therefore come to the question of&mdash;</p>

<p>2. <cite>The Psychic Stimulation.</cite>&mdash;It is told of Bettina Brentano
that the first time she met Goethe she suddenly fell asleep on
his knee.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>This ecstatic sleep in the midst of extremest torture, the

<p>With susceptible subjects relatively insignificant stimuli
suffice to bring about the somnambulic state. Thus a
sensitive lady had to have a splinter cut out of her finger.
Without any kind of bodily change she suddenly saw herself
sitting by the side of a brook in a beautiful meadow,
plucking flowers. This condition lasted as long as the
slight operation and then disappeared spontaneously.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Loewenfeld<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> has noticed unintentional inducement of
hysterical lethargy through hypnosis.</p>

<p>Our case has certain resemblances to hysterical lethargy<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
as described by Loewenfeld, viz. the shallow breathing, the
diminution of the pulse, the corpse-like pallor of the face,
and further the peculiar feeling of dying and the thoughts
of death.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The retention of one sense is not inconsistent with lethargy:
thus in certain cases of trance the sense of hearing remains.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>In Bonamaison's<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> case not only was the sense of touch
retained, but the senses of hearing and smell were quickened.
The hallucinatory content and loud speaking is also met with
in persons with hallucinations in lethargy.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Usually there
prevails total amnesia for the lethargic interval. Loewenfeld's<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
case D. had, however, a fleeting recollection; in
Bonamaison's case there was no amnesia. Lethargic patients
do not prove susceptible to the usual waking stimuli, but
Loewenfeld succeeded with his patient St. in turning the
lethargy into hypnosis by means of mesmeric passes, thus
combining it with the rest of consciousness during the
attack.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Our patient showed herself absolutely insusceptible
in the beginning of the lethargy, but later on she began to
speak spontaneously, was incapable of giving any attention
when her somnambulic ego was speaking, but could attend
when it was one of her automatic personalities. In this last
case it is probable that the hypnotic effect of the automatisms
succeeded in achieving a partial transformation of
the lethargy into hypnosis. When we consider that, according
to Loewenfeld's view, the lethargic disposition must not be
"too readily identified with the peculiar condition of the
nervous apparatus in hysteria," then the idea of the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
heredity of this disposition in our case becomes not a little
probable. The disease is much complicated by these attacks.</p>

<p>So far we have seen that the patient's consciousness of
her ego is identical in all the states. We have discussed
two secondary complexes of consciousness and have followed
them into the somnambulic attack, where they appear as the
patient's vision when she had lost her motor activity during
the attack. During the next attacks she was impervious to
any external incidents, but on the other hand developed,
within the twilight state, all the more intense activity, in
the form of visions. It seems that many secondary series
of ideas must have split off quite early from the primary
unconscious personality, for already, after the first two
séances, "spirits" appeared by the dozen. The names were
inexhaustible in variety, but the differences between the
personalities were soon exhausted and it became apparent
that they could all be subsumed under two types, the <em>serio-religious</em>
type and the <em>gay-hilarious</em>. So far it was really
only a matter of <em>two different unconscious personalities</em>, which
appeared under different names but had no essential differences.
The older type, the grandfather, who had initiated the
automatisms, also first began to make use of the twilight
state. I am not able to remember any suggestion which
might have given rise to the automatic speaking. According
to the preceding view, the attack in such circumstances
might be regarded as a partial auto-hypnosis. The ego-consciousness
which remains and, as a result of its isolation
from the external world, occupies itself entirely with its
hallucinations, is what is left over of the waking consciousness.
Thus the automatism has a wide field for its activity.
The independence of the individual central spheres which we
have proved at the beginning to be present in the patient,
makes the automatic act of speaking appear intelligible.
Just as the dreamer on occasion speaks in his sleep, so, too,
a man in his waking hours may accompany intensive thought
with an unconscious whisper.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The peculiar movements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the speech-musculature are to be noted. They have also
been observed in other somnambulists.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>These clumsy attempts must be directly paralleled with
the unintelligent and clumsy movements of the table or glass,
and most probably correspond to the <em>preliminary activity</em> of
the motor portion of the presentation; that is to say, a
stimulus limited to the motor-centre which has not previously
been subordinated to any higher system. Whether the like
occurs in persons who talk in their dreams, I do not know.
But it has been observed in hypnotised persons.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Since the convenient medium of speech was used as the
means of communication, the study of the subconscious
personalities was considerably lightened. Their intellectual
compass is a relatively mediocre one. Their knowledge
is greater than that of the waking patient, including also
a few occasional details, such as the birthdays of dead
strangers and the like. The source of these is more or
less obscure, since the patient does not know whence in the
ordinary way she could have procured the knowledge of
these facts. These are cases of so-called cryptomnesia, which
are too unimportant to deserve more extended notice.
The intelligence of the two subconscious persons is very
slight; they produce banalities almost exclusively, but their
relation to the conscious ego of the patient when in the
somnambulic state is interesting. They are invariably
aware of everything that takes place during ecstasy and
occasionally they render an exact report from minute to
minute.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The subconscious persons only know the patient's phantastic
changes of thought very superficially; they do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
understand these and cannot answer a single question concerning
the situation. Their stereotyped reference to Ivenes
is: "Ask Ivenes." This observation reveals a dualism in the
character of the subconscious personalities difficult to explain;
for the grandfather, who gives information by automatic speech,
also appears to Ivenes and, according to her account, teaches her
about the objects in question. How is it that, when the grandfather
speaks through the patient's mouth, he knows nothing
of the very things which he himself teaches her in the ecstasies?</p>

<p>We must again return to the discussion of the first
appearance of the hallucinations. We picture the vision,
then, as an irruption of hypnosis into the visual sphere.
That irruption does not lead to a "normal" hypnosis, but to
a "hystero-hypnosis," that is, the simple hypnosis is complicated
by a hysterical attack.</p>

<p>It is not a rare occurrence in the domain of hypnotism
for normal hypnosis to be disturbed, or rather to be replaced
by the unexpected appearance of hysterical somnambulism;
the hypnotist in many cases then loses rapport with the
patient. In our case the automatism arising in the motor
area plays the part of hypnotist; the suggestions proceeding
from it (called objective auto-suggestions) hypnotise the
neighbouring areas in which a certain susceptibility has
arisen. At the moment when the hypnotism flows over
into the visual sphere, the hysterical attack occurs which, as
remarked, effects a very deep-reaching change in a large
portion of the psychical region. We must now suppose that
the automatism stands in the same relationship to the attack
as the hypnotist to a pathological hypnosis; its influence upon
the further structure of the situation is lost. The hallucinatory
appearance of the hypnotised personality, or rather of
the suggested idea, may be regarded as the last effect upon
the somnambulic personality. Thenceforward the hypnotist
becomes only a figure with whom the somnambulic personality
occupies itself independently: he can only state
what is going on and is no longer the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">conditio sine qua non</i>
of the content of the somnambulic attack. The independent
ego-complex of the attack, in our case Ivenes, has now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
upper hand. She groups her own mental products around
the personality of the hypnotiser, that is, of the grandfather,
now degraded to a mere image. In this way we are enabled
to understand the dualism in the character of the grandfather.
<em>The grandfather I. who speaks directly to those present,
is a totally different person and a mere spectator of his double,
grandfather II., who appears as Ivenes' teacher.</em> Grandfather I.
maintains energetically that both are one and the same
person, and that I. has all the knowledge which II. possesses,
and is only prevented from giving information by the
difficulties of speech. (The dissociation was of course not
realized by the patient, who took both to be one person.)
Grandfather I., if closely examined, however, is not altogether
wrong, judging from one fact which seems to make for the
identity of I. and II., viz. that they are never both present
together. When I. speaks automatically, II. is not present;
Ivenes remarks on his absence. Similarly, during the ecstasy,
when she is with II., she cannot say where I. is, or she may
learn only on returning from an imaginary journey that
meanwhile I. has been guarding her body. Conversely I.
never says that he is going on a journey with Ivenes and
never explains anything to her. This behaviour should be
noted, for if I. is really separate from II., there seems no
reason why he should not speak automatically at the same
time that II. appears, and be present with II. in the ecstasy.
Although this might have been supposed possible, as a matter
of fact it was never observed. How is this dilemma to be
resolved? At all events there exists an identity of I. and
II., but it does not lie in the region of the personality
under discussion; it lies in the basis common to both; that
is, in the personality of the subject which in deepest
essence is one and indivisible. Here we come across the
characteristic of all hysterical dissociations of consciousness.
<em>They are disturbances which only belong to the superficial, and
none reaches so deep as to attack the strong-knit foundation of
the ego-complex.</em></p>

<p>In many such cases we can find the bridge which, although
often well-concealed, spans the apparently impassable abyss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
For instance, by suggestion, one of four cards is made invisible
to a hypnotised person; he thereupon names the other
three. A pencil is placed in his hand with the instruction
to write down all the cards lying there; he correctly adds
the fourth one.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>In the aura of his hystero-epileptic attacks a patient of
Janet's<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> invariably had a vision of a conflagration, and
whenever he saw an open fire he had an attack; indeed,
the sight of a lighted match was sufficient to bring about an
attack. The patient's visual field on the left side was limited
to 30°, the right eye was shut. The left eye was fixed in the
middle of a perimeter whilst a lighted match was held at 80°.
The hystero-epileptic attack took place immediately. Despite
the extensive amnesia in many cases of double consciousness,
the patients' behaviour does not correspond to the degree of
their ignorance, but it seems rather as if a deeper instinct
guided their actions in accordance with their former knowledge.
Not only this relatively slight amnesic dissociation,
but the severe amnesia of the epileptic twilight-state, formerly
regarded as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">irreparabile damnum</i>, does not suffice to cut the
inmost threads which bind the ego-complex in the twilight-state
to the normal ego. In one case the content of the
twilight-state could be grafted on to the waking ego-complex.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Making use of these experiments for our case, we obtain
the helpful hypothesis that those layers of the unconscious
beyond reach of the dissociation endeavour to present the
unity of automatic personality. This endeavour is shattered
in the deeper-seated and more elemental disturbance of the
hysterical attack,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> which prevents a more complete synthesis
by the tacking on of associations which are to a certain
extent the most original individual property of supraliminal
personality. <em>As the Ivenes dream emerged it was fitted on to
the figures accidentally in the field of vision, and henceforth
remains associated with them.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Relationship to the Unconscious Personality.</span></p>

<p>As we have seen, the numerous personalities become
grouped round two types, the grandfather and Ulrich von
Gerbenstein. The first produces exclusively sanctimonious
religiosity and gives edifying moral precepts. The latter is,
in one word, a "flapper," in whom there is nothing male
except the name. We must here add from the anamnesis
that at fifteen the patient was confirmed by a very bigoted
clergyman, and at home she is occasionally the recipient of
sanctimonious moral talks. The grandfather represents this
side of her past, Gerbenstein the other half; hence the curious
contrast. Here we have personified the chief characteristics of
her past. On the one hand the sanctimonious person with
a narrow education, on the other the boisterousness of
a lively girl of fifteen who often overshoots the mark.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> We
find both sets of traits mixed in the patient in sharp contrast.
At times she is anxious, shy, and extremely reserved; at others
boisterous to a degree. She is herself often most painfully
aware of these contradictions. This circumstance gives us the
key to the source of the two unconscious personalities. The
patient is obviously seeking a middle path between the two
extremes; she endeavours to repress them and strains after
some ideal condition. These strainings bring her to the
puberty dream of the ideal Ivenes, beside whose figure the
unacknowledged trends of her character recede into the background.
They are not lost, however, but as repressed ideas,
analogous to the Ivenes idea, begin an independent existence
as automatic personalities.</p>

<p>S. W.'s behaviour recalls vividly Freud's<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> investigations
into dreams which disclose the independent growth of repressed
thoughts. We can now comprehend why the hallucinatory
persons are separated from those who write and speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>automatically. The former teach Ivenes the secrets of the
Other Side, they relate all those phantastic tales about the
extraordinariness of her personality, they create scenes where
Ivenes can appear dramatically with the attributes of power,
wisdom and virtue. These are nothing but dramatic dissociations
of her dream-self. The latter, the automatic persons,
are the ones to be overcome, they must have no part in
Ivenes. With the spirit-companions of Ivenes they have
only the name in common. <em>A priori</em>, it is not to be expected
that in a case like ours, where these divisions are never
clearly defined, that two such characteristic individualities
should disappear entirely from a somnambulic ego-complex
having so close a relation with the waking consciousness.
And in fact, we do meet them in part in those ecstatic
penitential scenes and in part in the romances crammed
with more or less banal, mischievous gossip.</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Course.</span></p>

<p>It only remains to say a few words about the course of
this strange affection. The process reached its maximum in
four to eight weeks. The descriptions given of Ivenes and
of the unconscious personalities belong generally to this
period. Thenceforth a gradual decline was noticeable; the
ecstasies grew meaningless and the influence of Gerbenstein
became more powerful. The phenomena gradually lost
their distinctive features, the characters which were at
first well demarcated became by degrees inextricably mixed.
The psychological contribution grew smaller and smaller
until finally the whole story assumed a marked effect of
fabrication. Ivenes herself was much concerned about this
decline; she became painfully uncertain, spoke cautiously,
feeling her way, and allowed her character to appear undisguised.
The somnambulic attacks decreased in frequency
and intensity. All degrees from somnambulism to conscious
lying were observable. Thus the curtain fell. The patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
has since gone abroad. We should not underestimate the importance
of the fact that her character has become pleasanter
and more stable. Here we may recall the cases cited in
which the second state gradually replaced the first state.
Perhaps this is a similar phenomenon.</p>

<p>It is well known that somnambulic manifestations sometimes
begin at puberty.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The attacks of somnambulism in
Dyce's case<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> began immediately before puberty and lasted
just till its termination. The somnambulism of H. Smith is
likewise closely connected with puberty.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Schroeder von der Kalk's patient was 16 years old at the
time of her illness; Felida 14-1/2, etc. We know also that
at this period the future character is formed and fixed. In
the case of Felida and of Mary Reynolds we saw that the
character in state II. replaced that of state I. <em>It is not therefore
unthinkable that these phenomena of double consciousness
are nothing but character-formations for the future personality,
or their attempts to burst forth.</em> In consequence of special
difficulties (unfavourable external conditions, psychopathic
disposition of the nervous system, etc.), <em>these new formations,
or attempts thereat, become bound up with peculiar disturbances
of consciousness</em>. Occasionally the somnambulism, in view of
the difficulties that oppose the future character, takes on a
marked teleological meaning, for it gives the individual, who
might otherwise be defeated, the means of victory. Here I
am thinking first of all of Jeanne d'Arc, whose extraordinary
courage recalls the deeds of Mary Reynolds' II. This is
perhaps the place to point out the similar function of the
"hallucination téléologique" of which the public reads
occasionally, although it has not yet been submitted to a
scientific study.</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">The Unconscious Additional Creative Work.</span></p>

<p>We have now discussed all the essential manifestations
offered by our case which are of significance for its inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
structure. Certain accompanying manifestations may be
briefly considered: <em>the unconscious additional creative work</em>.
Here we shall encounter a not altogether unjustifiable
scepticism on the part of the representative of science.
Dessoir's conception of a second ego met with much opposition,
and was rejected, as too impossible in many
directions. As is known, occultism has proclaimed a pre-eminent
right to this field and has drawn premature conclusions
from doubtful observations. We are indeed very far
from being in a position to state anything conclusive, since
we have at present only most inadequate material. Therefore
if we touch on the field of the unconscious additional creative
work, it is only that we may do justice to all sides of our
case. <em>By unconscious addition we understand that automatic
process whose result does not penetrate to the conscious psychic
activity of the individual.</em> To this region above all belongs
thought-reading through table movements. I do not know
whether there are people who can divine a whole long train
of thought by means of inductions from the intentional
tremulous movements. It is, however, certain that, assuming
this to be possible, such persons must be availing themselves
of a routine achieved after endless practice. But in our
case long practice can be excluded without more ado, and
there is nothing left but to accept a primary susceptibility of
the unconscious, far exceeding that of the conscious.</p>

<p>This supposition is supported by numerous observations
on somnambulists. I will mention only Binet's<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> experiments,
where little letters or some such thing, or little complicated
figures in relief were laid on the anæsthetic skin of the back
of the hand or the neck, and the unconscious perceptions
were then recorded by means of signs. On the basis of these
experiments he came to the following conclusion: "D'après
les calculs que j'ai pu faire, la sensibilité inconsciente d'une
hystérique est à certains moments <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cinquante fois</i> plus fine que
celle d'une personne normale." A second additional creation
coming under consideration in our case and in numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
other somnambulists, is that condition which French investigators
call "cryptomnesia."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> By this term is meant the
becoming conscious of a memory-picture which cannot be
regarded as in itself primary, but at most is secondary, by
means of subsequent recalling or abstract reasoning. It is
characteristic of cryptomnesia that the picture which emerges
does not bear the obvious mark of the memory-picture, is not,
that is to say, bound up with the idiosyncratic super-conscious
ego-complex.</p>

<p>Three ways may be distinguished in which the cryptomnesic
picture is brought to consciousness.</p>

<p>1. <em>The picture enters consciousness without any intervention
of the sense-spheres (intra-psychically).</em> It is an inrushing idea
whose causal sequence is hidden within the individual. In
so far cryptomnesia is quite an everyday occurrence, concerned
with the deepest normal psychic events. How often
it misleads the investigator, the author or the composer
into believing his ideas original, whilst the critic quite well
recognises their source! Generally the individuality of the
representation protects the author from the accusation of
plagiarism and proves his good faith; still, cases do occur
of unconscious verbal reproduction. Should the passage in
question contain some remarkable idea, the accusation of
plagiarism, more or less conscious, is justified. After all,
a valuable idea is linked by numerous associations with the
ego-complex; at different times, in different situations, it has
already been meditated upon and thus leads by innumerable
links in all directions. It can therefore never so disappear
from consciousness that its continuity could be entirely lost
from the sphere of conscious memory. We have, however,
a criterion by which we can always recognise objectively
intra-psychic cryptomnesia. The cryptomnesic presentation
is linked to the ego-complex by the minimum of associations.
The reason for this lies in the relation of the individual to
the particular object, in the disproportion of interest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
object. Two possibilities occur: (1) The object is worthy
of interest but the interest is slight in consequence of dispersion
or want of understanding; (2) The object is not
worthy of interest, consequently the interest is slight. In
both cases an extremely labile connection with consciousness
arises which leads to a rapid forgetting. The slight bridge
is soon destroyed and the acquired presentation sinks into
the unconscious, where it is no longer accessible to consciousness.
Should it enter consciousness by means of
cryptomnesia, the feeling of strangeness, of its being an
original creation, will cling to it because the path by which
it entered the subconscious has become undiscoverable.
Strangeness and original creation are, moreover, closely
allied to one another if one recalls the numerous witnesses
in <em>belles-lettres</em> to the nature of genius ("possession" by
genius).<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Apart from certain striking cases of this kind, where it
is doubtful whether it is a cryptomnesia or an original
creation, there are some cases in which a passage of no
essential content is reproduced, and that almost verbally,
as in the following example:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>About that time when Zarathustra lived on the
blissful islands, it came to pass that a ship cast anchor at that island
on which the smoking mountain standeth; and the sailors of that ship
went ashore in order to shoot rabbits! But about the hour of noon, when
the captain and his men had mustered again, they suddenly saw a man come
through the air unto them, and a voice said distinctly: "It is time! It
is high time!" But when that person was nighest unto them (he passed by
them flying quickly like a shadow, in the direction in which the volcano
was situated) they recognised with the greatest confusion that it was
Zarathustra. For all of them, except the captain, had seen him before,
and they loved him, as the folk love, blending love and awe in equal
parts. "Lo! there," said the old steersman, "Zarathustra goeth unto
hell!"</p>

<p>An extract of awe-inspiring import from the log of the ship "Sphinx"
in the year 1686, in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Just. Kerner, "Blätter aus Prevorst," vol. IV., p, 57.</p>

<p>The four captains and a merchant, Mr. Bell, went ashore on the island
of Mount Stromboli to shoot rabbits. At three o'clock they called the
crew together to go aboard, when, to their inexpressible astonishment,
they saw two men flying rapidly over them through the air. One was
dressed in black, the other in grey. They approached them very closely,
in the greatest haste; to their greatest dismay they descended amid the
burning flames into the crater of the terrible volcano, Mount Stromboli.
They recognised the pair as acquaintances from London.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Frau E. Förster-Nietzsche, the poet's sister, told me,
in reply to my inquiry, that Nietzsche took up Just. Kerner
between the age of twelve and fifteen, when stopping with
his grandfather, Pastor Oehler, in Pobler, but certainly never
afterwards. It could never have been the poet's intention to
commit a plagiarism from a ship's log; if this had been the
case, he would certainly have omitted the very prosaic "to
shoot rabbits," which was, moreover, quite unessential to the
situation. In the poetical sketch of Zarathustra's journey
into Hell there was obviously interpolated, half or wholly
unconsciously, that forgotten impression from his youth.</p>

<p>This is an instance which shows all the peculiarities of
cryptomnesia. A quite unessential detail, which deserves
nothing but speedy forgetting, is reproduced with almost
verbal fidelity, whilst the chief part of the narrative is, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
cannot say altered, but recreated quite distinctively. To the
distinctive core, the idea of the journey to Hell, there is
added a detail, the old, forgotten impression of a similar
situation. The original is so absurd that the youth, who
read everything, probably skipped through it, and certainly
had no deep interest in it. Here we get the required minimum
of associated links, for we cannot easily conceive a greater
jump, than from that old, absurd story to Nietzsche's consciousness
in the year 1883. If we picture to ourselves
Nietzsche's mood at the time when "Zarathustra" was composed,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
and think of the ecstasy that at more than one
point approached the pathological, we shall comprehend the
abnormal reminiscence. The second of the two possibilities
mentioned, the acceptance of some object, not itself uninteresting,
in a state of dispersion or half interest from lack
of understanding, and its cryptomnesic reproduction we find
chiefly in somnambulists; it is also found in the literary
chronicles dealing with dying celebrities.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Amid the exhaustive selection of these phenomena we are
chiefly concerned with <em>talking in a foreign tongue, the so-called
glossolalia</em>. This phenomenon is mentioned everywhere
when it is a question of similar ecstatic conditions. In the
New Testament, in the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> in the Witchcraft
Trials, more recently in the Prophetess of Prevorst, in Judge
Edmond's daughter Laura, in Flournoy's Helen Smith. The
last is unique from the point of view of investigation; it is
found also in Bresler's<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> case, which is probably identical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
with Blumhardt's<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Gottlieben Dittus. As Flournoy shows,
glossolalia is, so far as it really is independent speech, a
cryptomnesic phenomenon, [Greek: Kat' exochên]. The reader should
consult Flournoy's most interesting exposition.</p>

<p>In our case glossolalia was only once observed, when the
only understandable words were the scattered variations on
the word "vena." The source of this word is clear. A few
days previously the patient had dipped into an anatomical
atlas for the study of the veins of the face, which were given
in Latin. She had used the word "vena" in her dreams,
as happens occasionally to normal persons. The remaining
words and sentences in a foreign language betray, at the
first glance, their derivation from French, in which the
patient was somewhat fluent. Unfortunately I am without
the more accurate translations of the various sentences,
because the patient would not give them; but we may hold
that it was a phenomenon similar to Helen Smith's Martian
language. Flournoy found that the Martian language was
nothing but a childish translation from French; the words
were changed but the syntax remained the same. Even more
probable is the view that the patient simply ranged next to
each other meaningless words that rang strangely, without
any true word-formation;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> she borrowed certain characteristic
sounds from French and Italian and combined them into a
kind of language, just as Helen Smith completed the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lacunæ</i>
in the real Sanscrit words by products of her own resembling
that language. The curious names of the mystical system
can be reduced, for the most part, to known roots. The
writer vividly recalls the botanical schemes found in every
school atlas; the internal resemblance of the relationship of
the planets to the sun is also pretty clear; we shall not be
going astray if we see in the names reminiscences from
popular astronomy. Thus can be explained the names
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>Persus, Fenus, Nenus, Sirum, Surus, Fixus, and Pix, as the
childlike distortions of Perseus, Venus, Sirius and Fixed Star,
analogous to the Vena variations. Magnesor vividly recalls
Magnetism, whose mystic significance the patient knew from
the Prophetess of Prevorst. In Connesor, the contrary to
Magnesor, the prefix "con" is probably the French "contre."
Hypnos and Hyfonismus recall hypnosis and hypnotism
(German <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">hypnotismus</i>), about which there are the most superstitious
ideas circulating in lay circles. The most used
suffixes in "us" and "os" are the signs by which as a rule
people decide the difference between Latin and Greek. The
other names probably spring from similar accidents to which
we have no clues. The rudimentary glossolalia of our case has
not any title to be a classical instance of cryptomnesia, for it
only consisted in the unconscious use of various impressions,
partly optical, party acoustic, and all very close at hand.</p>

<p>2. <em>The cryptomnesic image arrives at consciousness through
the senses (as a hallucination).</em> Helen Smith is the classic
example of this kind. I refer to the case mentioned on the
date "18 Mars."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>3. <em>The image arrives at consciousness by motor automatism.</em>
H. Smith had lost her valuable brooch, which she was
anxiously looking for everywhere. Ten days later her guide
Leopold informed her by means of the table where the brooch
was. Thus informed, she found it at night-time in the open
field, covered by sand.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Strictly speaking, in cryptomnesia
there is not any additional creation in the true sense of the
word, since the conscious memory experiences no increase of
its function, but only an enrichment of its content. By the
automatism certain regions are merely made accessible to
consciousness in an indirect way, which were formerly sealed
against it. But the unconscious does not thereby accomplish
any creation which exceeds the capacity of consciousness
qualitatively or quantitatively. Cryptomnesia is only an
apparent additional creation, in contrast to hypermnesia,
which actually represents an increase of function.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>We have spoken above of a receptivity of the unconscious
greater than that of the consciousness, chiefly in regard
to the simple attempts at thought-reading of numbers.
As mentioned, not only our somnambulist but a relatively
large number of normal persons are able to guess from the
tremors lengthy thought-sequences, if they are not too complicated.
These experiments are, so to speak, the prototype
of those rarer and incomparably more astonishing cases of
intuitive knowledge displayed at times by somnambulists.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Zschokke<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> in his "Introspection" has shown us that these
phenomena do not belong only to the domain of somnambulism,
but occur among non-somnambulic persons. The formation
of such knowledge seems to be arrived at in various ways:
first and foremost there is the fineness, already noted, of
unconscious perceptions; then must be emphasised the
importance of the enormous suggestibility of somnambulists.
<em>The somnambulist not only incorporates every suggestive idea to
some extent, but actually lives in the suggestion, in the person
of his doctor or observer, with that abandonment characteristic of
the suggestible hysteric.</em> The relation of Frau Hauffe to Kerner
is a striking example of this. That in such cases there is a
high degree of <em>association-concordance</em> can cause no astonishment;
a condition which Richet might have taken more
account of in his experiments in thought-transference.
Finally there are cases of somnambulic additional creative
work which are not to be explained solely by hyperæsthesia
of the unconscious activity of the senses and association-concordance,
but presuppose a highly developed intellectual
activity of the unconscious. The deciphering of the purposive
tremors demand an extreme sensitiveness and delicacy
of feeling, both psychological and physiological, to combine
the individual perceptions into a complete unity of thought,
if it is at all permissible to make an analogy between the
processes of cognition in the realm of the unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and the conscious. The possibility must always be considered
that <em>in the unconscious, feeling and concept are not
clearly separated</em>, perhaps even are one. The intellectual
elevation which certain somnambulists display in ecstasy,
though a rare thing, is none the less one that has sometimes
been observed.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> I would designate the scheme composed
by our patient as just one of those pieces of creative
work that exceed the normal intelligence. We have already
seen whence one portion of this scheme probably came. A
second source is no doubt the life-crisis of Frau Hauffe,
portrayed in Kerner's book. The external form seems to be
determined by these adventitious facts. As already observed
in the presentation of the case, the idea of dualism arises
from the conversations picked up piecemeal by the patient
during those dreamy states occurring after her ecstasies.
This exhausts my knowledge of the sources of S. W.'s
creations. Whence arose the root-idea the patient is unable
to say. I naturally examined occultistic literature pertinent
to the subject, and discovered a store of parallels with her
gnostic system from different centuries scattered through all
kinds of work mostly quite inaccessible to the patient. Moreover,
at her youthful age, and with her surroundings, the
possibility of any such study is quite excluded. A brief
survey of the system in the light of her own explanations
shows how much intelligence was used in its construction.
How highly the intellectual work is to be estimated is a
matter of opinion. In any case, considering her youth, her
mentality must be regarded as quite extraordinary.</p>

<p class="p4">THE ASSOCIATION METHOD</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Lecture I<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>When you honoured me with an invitation to lecture at Clark
University, a wish was expressed that I should speak about
my methods of work, and especially about the psychology of
childhood. I hope to accomplish this task in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>In my first lecture I will give to you the view points
of my association methods; in my second I will discuss the
significance of the familiar constellations; while in my third
lecture I shall enter more fully into the psychology of the
child.</p>

<p>I might confine myself exclusively to my theoretical views,
but I believe it will be better to illustrate my lectures with
as many practical examples as possible. We will therefore
occupy ourselves first with the association test which has
been of great value to me both practically and theoretically.
The history of the association method in vogue in psychology,
as well as the method itself, is, of course, so familiar to
you that there is no need to enlarge upon it. For practical
purposes I make use of the following formula:&mdash;</p>

<p>This formula has been constructed after many years of
experience. The words are chosen and partially arranged in
such a manner as to strike easily almost all complexes which
occur in practice. As shown above, there is a regulated
mixing of the grammatical qualities of the words. For this
there are definite reasons.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Before the experiment begins the test person receives the
following instruction: "Answer as quickly as possible with
the first word that occurs to your mind." This instruction is
so simple that it can easily be followed. The work itself,
moreover, appears extremely easy, so that it might be
expected any one could accomplish it with the greatest facility
and promptitude. But, contrary to expectation, the behaviour
is quite otherwise.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes us is the fact that many test-persons
show a marked prolongation of the reaction time.
This would seem to be suggestive of intellectual difficulties,&mdash;wrongly
however, for we are often dealing with very
intelligent persons of fluent speech. The explanation lies
rather in the emotions. In order to understand the matter,
comprehensively, we must bear in mind that the association
experiments cannot deal with a separated psychic function,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
for any psychic occurrence is never a thing in itself, but is
always the resultant of the entire psychological past. The
association experiment, too, is not merely a method for the
reproduction of separated word couplets, but it is a kind of
pastime, a conversation between experimenter and test-person.
In a certain sense it is still more than that. Words really
represent condensed actions, situations, and things. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
give a stimulus word to the test-person, which denotes an
action, it is as if I represented to him the action itself, and
asked him, "How do you behave towards it? What do you
think of it? What would you do in this situation?" If I
were a magician, I should cause the situation corresponding
to the stimulus word to appear in reality, and placing the
test-person in its midst, I should then study his manner of
reaction. The result of my stimulus words would thus
undoubtedly approach infinitely nearer perfection. But as
we are not magicians, we must be contented with the
linguistic substitutes for reality; at the same time we
must not forget that the stimulus word will almost without
exception conjure up its corresponding situation. All depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
on how the test-person reacts to this situation. The word
"bride" or "bridegroom" will not evoke a simple reaction in
a young lady; but the reaction will be deeply influenced by
the strong feeling tones evoked, the more so if the experimenter
be a man. It thus happens that the test-person is
often unable to react quickly and smoothly to all stimulus
words. There are certain stimulus words which denote
actions, situations, or things, about which the test-person
cannot think quickly and surely, and this fact is demonstrated
in the association experiments. The examples which I have
just given show an abundance of long reaction times and
other disturbances. In this case the reaction to the stimulus
word is in some way impeded, that is, the adaptation to the
stimulus word is disturbed. The stimulus words therefore
act upon us just as reality acts; indeed, a person who shows
such great disturbances to the stimulus words, is in a certain
sense but imperfectly adapted to reality. Disease itself is
an imperfect adaptation; hence in this case we are dealing
with something morbid in the psyche,&mdash;with something which
is either temporarily or persistently pathological in character,
that is, we are dealing with a psychoneurosis, with a functional
disturbance of the mind. This rule, however, as we
shall see later, is not without its exceptions.</p>

<p>Let us, in the first place, continue the discussion concerning
the prolonged reaction time. It often happens that
the test-person actually does <em>not</em> know what to answer to the
stimulus word. He waives any reaction, and for the moment
he totally fails to obey the original instructions, and shows
himself incapable of adapting himself to the experimenter.
If this phenomenon occurs frequently in an experiment, it
signifies a high degree of disturbance in adjustment. I would
call attention to the fact that it is quite indifferent what
reason the test-person gives for the refusal. Some find that
too many ideas suddenly occur to them; others, that they
suffer from a deficiency of ideas. In most cases, however,
the difficulties first perceived are so deterrent that they
actually give up the whole reaction. The following example
shows a case of hysteria with many failures of reaction:&mdash;</p>

<p>In example II. we find a characteristic phenomenon. The
test-person is not content with the requirements of the
instruction, that is, she is not satisfied with <em>one</em> word, but
reacts with many words. She apparently does more and
better than the instruction requires, but in so doing she does
not fulfil the requirements of the instruction. Thus she
reacts:&mdash;custom&mdash;good&mdash;barbaric; foolish&mdash;narrow minded&mdash;restricted;
family&mdash;big&mdash;small&mdash;everything possible.</p>

<p>These examples show in the first place that many other
words connect themselves with the reaction word. The test
person is unable to suppress the ideas which subsequently
occur to her. She also pursues a certain tendency which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
perhaps is more exactly expressed in the following reaction:
new&mdash;old&mdash;as an opposite. The addition of "as an opposite"
denotes that the test-person has the desire to add something
explanatory or supplementary. This tendency is also shown
in the following reaction: finger&mdash;not only hand, also foot&mdash;a
limb&mdash;member&mdash;extremity.</p>

<p>Here we have a whole series of supplements. It seems
as if the reaction were not sufficient for the test-person, something
else must always be added, as if what has already been
said were incorrect or in some way imperfect. This feeling
is what Janet designates the "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sentiment d'incomplétude</i>,"
but this by no means explains everything. I go somewhat
deeply into this phenomenon because it is very frequently
met with in neurotic individuals. It is not merely a small
and unimportant subsidiary manifestation demonstrable in an
insignificant experiment, but rather an elemental and universal
manifestation which plays a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> in other ways in the
psychic life of neurotics.</p>

<p>By his desire to supplement, the test-person betrays a
tendency to give the experimenter more than he wants, he
actually makes great efforts to find further mental occurrences
in order finally to discover something quite satisfactory. If
we translate this observation into the psychology of everyday
life, it signifies that the test-person has a constant tendency
to give to others more feeling than is required and expected.
According to Freud, this is a sign of a reinforced object-libido,
that is, it is a compensation for an inner want of
satisfaction and voidness of feeling. This elementary observation
therefore displays one of the characteristics of hysterics,
namely, the tendency to allow themselves to be carried away
by everything, to attach themselves enthusiastically to everything,
and always to promise too much and hence perform too
little. Patients with this symptom are, in my experience,
always hard to deal with; at first they are enthusiastically
enamoured of the physician, for a time going so far as to
accept everything he says blindly; but they soon merge into
an equally blind resistance against him, thus rendering any
educative influence absolutely impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>We see therefore in this type of reaction an expression of
a tendency to give more than is asked or expected. This
tendency betrays itself also in other failures to follow the
instruction:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>to quarrel&mdash;angry&mdash;different things&mdash;I always quarrel at home;<br />
to marry&mdash;how can you marry?&mdash;reunion&mdash;union;<br />
plum&mdash;to eat&mdash;to pluck&mdash;what do you mean by it?&mdash;is it symbolic?<br />
to sin&mdash;this idea is quite strange to me, I do not recognise it.</p></blockquote>

<p>These reactions show that the test-person gets away
altogether from the situation of the experiment. For the
instruction was, that he should answer only with the first
word which occurs to him. But here we note that the stimulus
words act with excessive strength, that they are taken as
if they were direct personal questions. The test-person
entirely forgets that we deal with mere words which stand
in print before us, but finds a personal meaning in them;
he tries to divine their intention and defend himself against
them, thus altogether forgetting the original instructions.</p>

<p>This elementary observation discloses another common
peculiarity of hysterics, namely, that of taking everything
personally, of never being able to remain objective, and of
allowing themselves to be carried away by momentary impressions;
this again shows the characteristics of the enhanced
object-libido.</p>

<p>Yet another sign of impeded adaptation is the often
occurring <em>repetition of the stimulus words</em>. The test-persons
repeat the stimulus word as if they had not heard or understood
it distinctly. They repeat it just as we repeat a
difficult question in order to grasp it better before answering.
This same tendency is shown in the experiment. The
questions are repeated because the stimulus words act on
hysterical individuals in much the same way as difficult
personal questions. In principle it is the same phenomenon
as the subsequent completion of the reaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>In many experiments we observe that the same reaction
constantly reappears to the most varied stimulus words.
These words seem to possess a special reproduction tendency,
and it is very interesting to examine their relationship to the
test-person. For example, I have observed a case in which
the patient repeated the word "short" a great many times
and often in places where it had no meaning. The test-person
could not directly state the reason for the repetition
of the word "short." From experience I knew that such
predicates always relate either to the test-person himself or
to the person nearest to him. I assumed that in this word
"short" he designated himself, and that in this way he
helped to express something very painful to him. The test-person
is of very small stature. He is the youngest of four
brothers, who, in contrast to himself, are all tall. He was
always the "<em>child</em>" in the family; he was nicknamed
"Short" and was treated by all as the "little one." This
resulted in a total loss of self-confidence. Although he was
intelligent, and despite long study, he could not decide to
present himself for examination; he finally became impotent,
and merged into a psychosis in which, whenever he
was alone, he took delight in walking about in his room on
his toes in order to appear taller. The word "short," therefore,
stood to him for a great many painful experiences.
This is usually the case with the perseverated words; they
always contain something of importance for the individual
psychology of the test-person.</p>

<p>The signs thus far discussed are not found spread about
in an arbitrary way through the whole experiment, but are
seen in very definite places, namely, where the stimulus
words strike against emotionally accentuated complexes.
This observation is the foundation of the so-called "diagnosis
of facts" (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Tatbestandsdiagnostik</i>). This method is
employed to discover, by means of an association experiment,
which is the culprit among a number of persons
suspected of a crime. That this is possible I will demonstrate
by the brief recital of a concrete case.</p>

<p>On the 6th of February, 1908, our supervisor reported to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
me that a nurse complained to her of having been robbed
during the forenoon of the previous day. The facts were as
follows: The nurse kept her money, amounting to 70 francs,
in a pocket-book which she had placed in her cupboard where
she also kept her clothes. The cupboard contained two
compartments, of which one belonged to the nurse who was
robbed, and the other to the head nurse. These two nurses
and a third one, who was an intimate friend of the head
nurse, slept in the room where the cupboard was. This room
was in a section which was occupied in common by six nurses
who had at all times free access to the room. Given such a
state of affairs it is not to be wondered that the supervisor
shrugged her shoulders when I asked her whom she most
suspected.</p>

<p>Further investigation showed that on the day of the
theft, the above-mentioned friend of the head nurse was
slightly indisposed and remained the whole morning in the
room in bed. Hence, unless she herself was the thief,
the theft could have taken place only in the afternoon. Of
four other nurses upon whom suspicion could possibly
fall, there was one who attended regularly to the cleaning of
the room in question, while the remaining three had nothing
to do in it, nor was it shown that any of them had spent any
time there on the previous day.</p>

<p>It was therefore natural that the last three nurses should
be regarded for the time being as less implicated, so I
began by subjecting the first three to the experiment.</p>

<p>From the information I had obtained of the case, I knew
that the cupboard was locked but that the key was kept near
by in a very conspicuous place, that on opening the cupboard
the first thing which would strike the eye was a fur boa, and,
moreover, that the pocket-book was between some linen in an
inconspicuous place. The pocket-book was of dark reddish
leather, and contained the following objects: a 50-franc banknote,
a 20-franc piece, some centimes, a small silver watch-chain,
a stencil used in the lunatic asylum to mark the kitchen
utensils, and a small receipt from Dosenbach's shoeshop in
Zürich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the plaintiff, only the head nurse knew the exact
particulars of the deed, for as soon as the former missed
her money she immediately asked the head nurse to help
her find it, thus the head nurse had been able to learn the
smallest details, which naturally rendered the experiment
still more difficult, for she was precisely the one most
suspected. The conditions for the experiment were better
for the others, since they knew nothing concerning the
particulars of the deed, and some not even that a theft
had been committed. As critical stimulus words I selected
the name of the robbed nurse, plus the following words: cupboard,
door, open, key, yesterday, banknote, gold, 70, 50, 20,
money, watch, pocket-book, chain, silver, to hide, fur, dark
reddish, leather, centimes, stencil, receipt, Dosenbach. Besides
these words which referred directly to the deed, I took
also the following, which had a special effective value: theft,
to take, to steal, suspicion, blame, court, police, to lie, to
fear, to discover, to arrest, innocent.</p>

<p>The objection is often made to the last species of words
that they may produce a strong affective resentment even in
innocent persons, and for that reason one cannot attribute to
them any comparative value. Nevertheless, it may always
be questioned whether the affective resentment of an innocent
person will have the same effect on the association as that of
a guilty one, and that question can only be authoritatively
answered by experience. Until the contrary is demonstrated,
I maintain that words of the above-mentioned type may
profitably be used.</p>

<p>I distributed these critical words among twice as many
indifferent stimulus words in such a manner that each
critical word was followed by two indifferent ones. As a
rule it is well to follow up the critical words by indifferent
words in order that the action of the first may be clearly
distinguished. But one may also follow up one critical word
by another, especially if one wishes to bring into relief the
action of the second. Thus I placed together "darkish red"
and "leather," and "chain" and "silver."</p>

<p>After this preparatory work I undertook the experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
with the three above-mentioned nurses. Following the order
of the experiment, I shall denote the friend of the head
nurse by the letter A, the head nurse by B, and the nurse
who attended to the cleaning of the room by C. As examinations
of this kind can be rendered into a foreign tongue only
with the greatest difficulty, I will content myself with presenting
the general results, and with giving some examples.
I first undertook the experiment with A, and judging by
the circumstances she appeared only slightly moved. B
was next examined; she showed marked excitement, her
pulse being 120 per minute immediately after the experiment.
The last to be examined was C. She was the most
tranquil of the three; she displayed but little embarrassment,
and only in the course of the experiment did it occur
to her that she was suspected of stealing, a fact which
manifestly disturbed her towards the end of the experiment.</p>

<p>The general impression from the examination spoke
strongly against the head nurse B. It seemed to me that
she evinced a very "suspicious," or I might almost say,
"impudent" countenance. With the definite idea of finding
in her the guilty one I set about adding up the
results. You will see that I was wrong in my surmise and
that the test proved my error.</p>

<p>One can make use of many special methods of computing,
but they are not all equally good and equally exact. (One
must always resort to calculation, as appearances are enormously
deceptive.) The method which is most to be recommended
is that of the probable average of the reaction time.
It shows at a glance the difficulties which the person in the
experiment had to overcome in the reaction.</p>

<p>The technique of this calculation is very simple. The
probable average is the middle number of the various reaction
times arranged in a series. The reaction times are, for
example,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> placed in the following manner: 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7,
8, 9, 9, 9, 12, 13, 14. The number found in the middle (8)
is the probable average of this series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The probable averages of the reaction are:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="The probable averages">
<tr><td class="tdc">A</td><td class="tdc">B</td><td class="tdc">C</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdc">10·0</td><td class="tdc">12·0</td><td class="tdc">13·5.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>No conclusions can be drawn from this result. But the
average reaction times calculated separately for the indifferent
reactions, for the critical, and for those immediately following
the critical (post-critical) are more interesting.</p>

<p>From this example we see that whereas A has the shortest
reaction time for the indifferent reactions, she shows in comparison
to the other two persons of the experiment, the longest
time for the critical reactions.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The Probable Average of the Reaction Time.</span></p>

<div class="center">
<table border="bb" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="The Probable Average of the Reaction Time">

<tr><td class="tdl">Post-critical reactions &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">10·0</td><td class="tdl">11·0</td><td class="tdl">13·0</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The difference between the reaction times, let us say
between the indifferent and the critical, is 6 for A, 2 for B,
and 3 for C, that is, it is more than double for A when
compared with the other two persons.</p>

<p>In the same way we can calculate how many complex
indicators there are on an average for the indifferent, critical,
etc., reactions.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The Average Complex-Indicators for each Reaction.</span></p>

<div class="center">
<table border="bb" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="The Average Complex-Indicators for each Reaction">

<tr><td class="tdl">Post-critical reactions &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">0·6</td><td class="tdl">1·0</td><td class="tdl">0·8</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The difference between the indifferent and critical reactions
for A = 0·7, for B = 0, for C = 0·4. A is again the highest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Another question to consider is, the proportion of imperfect
reactions in each case.</p>

<p>The result for A = 34%, for B = 28%, and for C = 30%.</p>

<p>Here, too, A reaches the highest value, and in this, I
believe, we see the characteristic moment of the guilt-complex
in A. I am, however, unable to explain here circumstantially
the reasons why I maintain that memory errors are
related to an emotional complex, as this would lead me
beyond the limits of the present work. I therefore refer the
reader to my work "<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ueber die Reproductionsstörrungen im
Associationsexperiment</i>" (IX Beitrag der Diagnost. Associat.
Studien).<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>As it often happens that an association of strong feeling
tone produces in the experiment a perseveration, with the
result that not only the critical association, but also two or
three successive associations are imperfectly reproduced, it
will be very interesting to see how many imperfect reproductions
are so arranged in the series in our cases. The result
of computation shows that the imperfect reproductions thus
arranged in series are for A 64·7%, for B 55·5%, and for
C 30·0%.</p>

<p>Again we find that A has the greatest percentage. To be
sure, this may partially depend on the fact that A also
possesses the greatest number of imperfect reproductions.
Given a small number of reactions, it is usual that the
greater the total number of the same, the more the imperfect
reactions will occur in groups. But this cannot account for
the high proportion in our case, where, on the other hand,
B and C have not a much smaller number of imperfect
reactions when compared to A. It is significant that C with
her slight emotions during the experiment shows the minimum
of imperfect reproductions arranged in series.</p>

<p>As imperfect reproductions are also complex indicators, it
is necessary to see how they distribute themselves in respect
to the indifferent, critical, etc., reactions.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to bring into prominence the
differences between the indifferent and the critical reactions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of the various subjects as shown by the resulting numbers of
the table. In this respect, too, A occupies first place.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Imperfect Reproductions which Occur.</span></p>

<div class="center">
<table border="bb" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Imperfect Reproductions which Occur">

<tr><td class="tdl">Post-critical reactions &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">5</td><td class="tdl">7</td><td class="tdl">7</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Naturally, here, too, there is a probability that the
greater the number of the imperfect reproductions the
greater is their number in the critical reactions. If we
suppose that the imperfect reproductions are distributed
regularly and without choice, among all the reactions, there
will be a greater number of them for A (in comparison with B
and C) even as reactions to critical words, since A has the
greater number of imperfect reproductions. Admitting such
a uniform distribution of the imperfect reproductions, it is
easy to calculate how many we ought to expect to belong to
each individual kind of reaction.</p>

<p>From this calculation it appears that the disturbances
of reproductions which concern the critical reactions for A
greatly surpass the number expected, for C they are 0·9
higher, while for B they are lower.</p>

<p>All this points to the fact that in the subject A the critical
stimulus words acted with the greatest intensity, and hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the greatest suspicion falls on A. Practically relying on the
test one may assume the probability of this person's guilt.
The same evening A made a complete confession of the theft,
and thus the success of the experiment was confirmed.</p>

<p>Such a result is undoubtedly of scientific interest and
worthy of serious consideration. There is much in experimental
psychology which is of less use than the material
exemplified in this test. Putting the theoretical interest
altogether aside, we have here something that is not to be
despised from a practical point of view, to wit, a culprit
has been brought to light in a much easier and shorter way
than is customary. What has been possible once or twice
ought to be possible again, and it is well worth while to
investigate some means of rendering the method increasingly
capable of rapid and sure results.</p>

<p>This application of the experiment shows that it is
possible to strike a concealed, indeed an unconscious complex
by means of a stimulus word; and conversely we may assume
with great certainty that behind a reaction which shows a
complex indicator there is a hidden complex, even though
the test-person strongly denies it. One must get rid of the
idea that educated and intelligent test-persons are able to see
and admit their own complexes. Every human mind contains
much that is unacknowledged and hence unconscious as such;
and no one can boast that he stands completely above his
complexes. Those who persist in maintaining that they can,
are not aware of the spectacles upon their noses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has long been thought that the association experiment
enables one to distinguish certain <em>intellectual</em> types. That is
not the case. The experiment does not give us any particular
insight into the purely intellectual, but rather into the emotional
processes. To be sure we can erect certain types of
reaction; they are not, however, based on intellectual peculiarities,
but depend entirely on the <em>proportionate emotional states</em>.
Educated test-persons usually show superficial and linguistically
deep-rooted associations, whereas the uneducated form
more valuable associations and often of ingenious significance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
This behaviour would be paradoxical from an intellectual view-point.
The meaningful associations of the uneducated are not
really the product of intellectual thinking, but are simply the
results of a special emotional state. The whole thing is more
important to the uneducated, his emotion is greater, and for
that reason he pays more attention to the experiment than
the educated person, and his associations are therefore more
significant. Apart from those determined by education, we
have to consider three principal individual types:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. An objective type with undisturbed reactions.</p>

<p>2. A so-called complex-type with many disturbances in
the experiment occasioned by the constellation of a complex.</p>

<p>3. A so-called definition-type. The peculiarity of this type
consists in the fact that the reaction always gives an explanation
or a definition of the content of the stimulus word; <i>e.g.</i>:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>apple,&mdash;a tree-fruit;<br />
table,&mdash;a piece of household furniture;<br />
to promenade,&mdash;an activity;<br />
father,&mdash;chief of the family.</p></blockquote>

<p>This type is chiefly found in stupid persons, and it is therefore
quite usual in imbecility. But it can also be found in
persons who are not really stupid, but who do not wish <em>to be
taken as stupid</em>. Thus a young student from whom associations
were taken by an older intelligent woman student reacted
altogether with definitions. The test-person was of the
opinion that it was an examination in intelligence, and therefore
directed most of his attention to the significance of the
stimulus words; his associations, therefore, looked like those
of an idiot. All idiots, however, do not react with definitions;
probably only those react in this way who would like to
appear smarter than they are, that is, those to whom their
stupidity is painful. I call this widespread complex the
"intelligence-complex." A normal test-person reacts in a
most overdrawn manner as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>anxiety&mdash;heart anguish;<br />
to kiss&mdash;love's unfolding;<br />
to kiss&mdash;perception of friendship.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>This type gives a constrained and unnatural impression.
The test-persons wish to be more than they are, they wish to
exert more influence than they really have. Hence we see
that persons with an intelligence-complex are usually unnatural
and constrained; that they are always somewhat
stilted, or flowery; they show a predilection for complicated
foreign words, high-sounding quotations, and other intellectual
ornaments. In this way they wish to influence their fellow-beings,
they wish to impress others with their apparent
education and intelligence, and thus to compensate for their
painful feeling of stupidity. The definition-type is closely
related to the predicate-type, or, to express it more precisely,
to the predicate-type expressing personal judgment (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wertprädikattypus</i>).
For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>flower&mdash;pretty;<br />
money&mdash;convenient;<br />
animal&mdash;ugly;<br />
knife&mdash;dangerous;<br />
death&mdash;ghastly.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the definition type the <em>intellectual</em> significance of the
stimulus word is rendered prominent, but in the predicate
type its <em>emotional</em> significance. There are predicate-types
which show great exaggeration where reactions such as the
following appear:</p>

<blockquote><p>piano&mdash;horrible;<br />
to sing&mdash;heavenly;<br />
mother&mdash;ardently loved;<br />
father&mdash;something good, nice, holy.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the definition-type an absolutely <em>intellectual</em> make-up
is manifested or rather simulated, but here there is a very
<em>emotional</em> one. Yet, just as the definition-type really conceals
a lack of intelligence, so the excessive <em>emotional</em> expression
conceals or overcompensates an emotional deficiency. This
conclusion is very interestingly illustrated by the following
discovery:&mdash;On investigating the influence of the familiar
milieus on the association-type it was found that young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
people seldom possess a predicate-type, but that, on the
other hand, the predicate-type increases in frequency with
advancing age. In women the increase of the predicate-type
begins a little after the 40th year, and in men after the
60th. That is the precise time when, owing to the deficiency
of sexuality, there actually occurs considerable emotional loss.
If a test-person evinces a distinct predicate-type, it may always
be inferred that a marked internal emotional deficiency is
thereby compensated. Still, one cannot reason conversely,
namely, that an inner emotional deficiency must produce a
predicate-type, no more than that idiocy directly produces a
definition-type. A predicate-type can also betray itself
through the external behaviour, as, for example, through a
particular affectation, enthusiastic exclamations, an embellished
behaviour, and the constrained sounding language
so often observed in society.</p>

<p>The complex-type shows no particular tendency except the
<em>concealment</em> of a complex, whereas the definition and predicate
types betray a positive tendency to exert in some way a <em>definite</em>
influence on the experimenter. But whereas the definition-type
tends to bring to light its intelligence, the predicate-type
displays its emotion. I need hardly add of what importance
such determinations are for the diagnosis of character.</p>

<p>After finishing an association experiment I usually add
another of a different kind, the so-called <em>reproduction</em> experiment.
I repeat the same stimulus words and ask the test-persons
whether they still remember their former reactions.
In many instances the memory fails, and as experience shows,
these locations are stimulus words which touched an emotionally
accentuated complex, or stimulus words immediately
following such critical words.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has been designated as paradoxical and
contrary to all experience. For it is known that emotionally
accentuated things are better retained in memory than indifferent
things. This is quite true, but it does not hold for
the <em>linguistic</em> expression of an emotionally accentuated content.
On the contrary, one very easily forgets what he has
said under emotion, one is even apt to contradict himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
about it. Indeed, the efficacy of cross-examinations in court
depends on this fact. The reproduction method therefore
serves to render still more prominent the complex stimulus.
In normal persons we usually find a limited number of false
reproductions, seldom more than 19-20 per cent., while in
abnormal persons, especially in hysterics, we often find
from 20-40 per cent. of false reproductions. The reproduction
certainty is therefore in certain cases a measure for the emotivity
of the test-person.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By far the larger number of neurotics show a pronounced
tendency to cover up their intimate affairs in impenetrable
darkness, even from the doctor, so that he finds it very difficult
to form a proper picture of the patient's psychology. In such
cases I am greatly assisted by the association experiment.
When the experiment is finished, I first look over the general
course of the reaction times. I see a great many very prolonged
intervals; this means that the patient can only adjust
himself with difficulty, that his psychological functions proceed
with marked internal frictions with <em>resistances</em>. The
greater number of neurotics react only under great and very
definite resistances; there are, however, others in whom the
average reaction times are as short as in the normal, and in
whom the other complex indicators are lacking, but, despite
that fact, they undoubtedly present neurotic symptoms.
These rare cases are especially found among very intelligent
and educated persons, chronic patients who, after many
years of practice, have learned to control their outward
behaviour and therefore outwardly display very little if any
trace of their neuroses. The superficial observer would take
them for normal, yet in some places they show disturbances
which betray the repressed complex.</p>

<p>After examining the reaction times I turn my attention to
the type of the association to ascertain with what type I am
dealing. If it is a predicate-type I draw the conclusions which
I have detailed above; if it is a complex type I try to ascertain
the nature of the complex. With the necessary experience one
can readily emancipate one's judgment from the test-person's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
statements and almost without any previous knowledge of the
test-persons it is possible under certain circumstances to read
the most intimate complexes from the results of the experiment.
I look at first for the reproduction words and put them
together, and then I look for the stimulus words which show
the greatest disturbances. In many cases merely assorting
these words suffices to unearth the complex. In some cases
it is necessary to put a question here and there. The matter
is well illustrated by the following concrete example:</p>

<p>It concerns an educated woman of 30 years of age, married
three years previously. Since her marriage she has suffered
from episodic excitement in which she is violently jealous of her
husband. The marriage is a happy one in every other respect,
and it should be noted that the husband gives no cause for
the jealousy. The patient is sure that she loves him and
that her excited states are groundless. She cannot imagine
whence these excited states originate, and feels quite perplexed
over them. It is to be noted that she is a catholic
and has been brought up religiously, while her husband is
a protestant. This difference of religion did not admittedly
play any part. A more thorough anamnesis showed the
existence of an extreme prudishness. Thus, for example, no
one was allowed to talk in the patient's presence about her
sister's childbirth, because the sexual moment suggested
therein caused her the greatest excitement. She always undressed
in the adjoining room and never in her husband's
presence, etc. At the age of 27 she was supposed to have
had no idea how children were born. The associations gave
the results shown in the accompanying chart.</p>

<p>The stimulus words characterised by marked disturbances
are the following: yellow, to pray, to separate, to marry, to
quarrel, old, family, happiness, false, fear, to kiss, bride, to
choose, contented. The strongest disturbances are found in
the following stimulus words: <em>to pray</em>, <em>to marry</em>, <em>happiness</em>,
<em>false</em>, <em>fear</em>, and <em>contented</em>. These words, therefore, more than
any others, seem to strike the complex. The conclusions that
can be drawn from this is that she is not indifferent to the
fact that her husband is a protestant, that she again thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of praying, believes there is something wrong with marriage,
that she is false, entertains fancies of faithlessness, is afraid
(of the husband? of the future?), she is not contented with
her choice (to choose) and she thinks of separation. The
patient therefore has a separation complex, for she is very discontented
with her married life. When I told her this result
she was affected and at first attempted to deny it, then to mince
over it, but finally she admitted everything I said and added
more. She reproduced a large number of fancies of faithlessness,
reproaches against her husband, etc. <em>Her prudishness
and jealousy were merely a projection of her own sexual wishes on
her husband.</em> Because she was faithless in her fancies and did
not admit it to herself she was jealous of her husband.</p>

<p>It is impossible in a lecture to give a review of all the
manifold uses of the association experiment. I must content
myself with having demonstrated to you a few of its chief
uses.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Lecture II</span></p>

<p class="p3">THE FAMILIAL CONSTELLATIONS</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: As you have seen, there are
manifold ways in which the association experiment may be
employed in practical psychology. I should like to speak
to you to-day about another use of this experiment which
is primarily of theoretical significance. My pupil, Miss
Fürst, M.D., made the following researches: she applied
the association experiment to 24 families, consisting altogether
of 100 test-persons; the resulting material amounted to 22,200
associations. This material was elaborated in the following
manner: Fifteen separate groups were formed according to
logical-linguistic standards, and the associations were arranged
as follows:</p>

<p>As can be seen from this example, I utilise the difference to
demonstrate the degree of the analogy. In order to find a
basis for the sum of the resemblance I have calculated the
differences among all Dr. Fürst's test-persons, not related
among themselves, by comparing every female test-person
with all the other unrelated females; the same has been done
for the male test-persons.</p>

<p>The most marked difference is found in those cases where
the two test-persons compared have no associative quality in
common. All the groups are calculated in percentages, the
greatest difference possible being 200/15 = 13·3 per cent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I. The average difference of male unrelated test-persons is
5·9 per cent., and that of females of the same group is 6 per
cent.</p>

<p>II. The average difference between male related test-persons
is 4·1 per cent., and that between female related
tests-persons is 3·8 per cent. From these numbers we see
that relatives show a tendency to agreement in the reaction
type.</p>

<p>
III. Difference between fathers and children = 4·2.<br />

<p>One might indeed think that in this experiment, where full
scope is given to chance, individuality would become a factor
of the utmost importance, and that therefore one might expect
a very great diversity and lawlessness of associations. But
as we see the opposite is the case. Thus the daughter lives
contentedly in the same circle of ideas as her mother, not
only in her thought but in her form of expression; indeed,
she even uses the same words. What could be regarded
as more inconsequent, inconstant, and lawless than a fancy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a rapidly passing thought? It is not lawless, however,
neither is it free, but closely determined within the limits
of the milieu. If, therefore, even the superficial and manifestly
most inconsequent formations of the intellect are
altogether subject to the milieu-constellation, what must we
not expect for the more important conditions of the mind, for
the emotions, wishes, hopes, and intentions? Let us consider
a concrete example, illustrated by tracing A.</p>

<p>The mother is 45 years old and the daughter 16 years. Both
have a very distinct predicate-type expressing personal judgment,
both differ from the father in the most striking manner.
The father is a drunkard and a demoralised creature. We
can thus readily understand that his wife experiences an emotional
voidness which she naturally betrays by her enhanced
predicate-type. The same causes cannot, however, operate in
the case of the daughter, for, in the first place, she is not
married to a drunkard, and, in the second, life with all its hopes
and promises still lies before her. It is distinctly unnatural
for the daughter to show an extreme predicate-type expressing
personal judgment. She responds to the stimuli of the
environment just like her mother. But whereas in the mother
the type is in a way a natural consequence of her unhappy condition
of life, this condition is entirely lacking in the daughter.
The daughter simply imitates the mother; she merely appears
like the mother. Let us consider what this can signify for a
young girl. If a young girl reacts to the world like an old
woman, disappointed in life, this at once shows unnaturalness
and constraint. But more serious consequences are possible.
As you know the predicate-type is a manifestation of intensive
emotions; the emotions are always involved. Thus we cannot
prevent ourselves from responding inwardly, at least, to the
feelings and passions of our immediate environment; we allow
ourselves to be infected and carried away by it. Originally
the effects and their physical manifestations had a biological
significance; <i>i.e.</i> they were a protective mechanism for the
individual and the whole herd. If we manifest emotions, we
can with certainty expect to receive emotions in return. That
is the feeling of the predicate-type. What the 45-year-old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
woman lacks in emotions, <i>i.e.</i> in love in her marriage relations
she seeks to obtain in the outside world, and for that reason
she is an ardent participant in the Christian Science movement.
If the daughter imitates this situation she copies her
mother, she seeks to obtain emotions from the outside. But
for a girl of sixteen such an emotional state is, to say the least,
quite dangerous; like her mother, she reacts to her environment
as a sufferer soliciting sympathy. Such an emotional
state is no longer dangerous in the mother, but for obvious
reasons it is quite dangerous in the daughter. Once freed
from her father and mother she will be like her mother,
<i>i.e.</i> she will be a suffering woman craving for inner gratification.
She will thus be exposed to the great danger of falling
a victim to brutality and of marrying a brute and inebriate
like her father.</p>

<p>This conception is of importance in the consideration of
the influence of environment and education. The example
shows what passes over from the mother to the child. It is
not the good and pious precepts, nor is it any other inculcation
of pedagogic truths that have a moulding influence upon
the character of the developing child, but what most influences
him is the peculiarly affective state which is totally unknown
to his parents and educators. The concealed discord between
the parents, the secret worry, the repressed hidden wishes,
all these produce in the individual a certain affective state
with its objective signs which slowly but surely, though
unconsciously, works its way into the child's mind, producing
therein the same conditions and hence the same reactions to
external stimuli. We know the depressing effect mournful and
melancholic persons have upon us. A restless and nervous
individual infects his surroundings with unrest and dissatisfaction,
a grumbler with his discontent, etc. Since grown-up
persons are so sensitive to surrounding influences, we should
certainly expect this to be even more noticeable among
children, whose minds are as soft and plastic as wax. The
father and mother impress deeply into the child's mind the
seal of their personality; the more sensitive and mouldable
the child the deeper is the impression. Thus things that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
never even spoken about are reflected in the child. The child
imitates the gesture, and just as the gesture of the parent is
the expression of an emotional state, so in turn the gesture
gradually produces in the child a similar feeling, as it feels
itself, so to speak, into the gesture. Just as the parents adapt
themselves to the world, so does the child. At the age of
puberty when it begins to free itself from the spell of the
family, it enters into life with, so to say, a surface adaptation
entirely in keeping with that of the father and mother. The
frequent and often very deep <em>depressions of puberty</em> emanate
from this; they are symptoms which are rooted in the difficulty
of new adjustment. The youthful person at first tries
to separate himself as much as possible from his family; he
may even estrange himself from it, but inwardly this only ties
him the more firmly to the parental image. I cite the case
of a young neurotic who ran away from his parents; he was
estranged from, and almost hostile to them, but he admitted
to me that he possessed a special sanctum; it was a strong
box containing his old childhood books, old dried flowers,
stones, and even small bottles of water from the well at his
home and from a river along which he walked with his
parents, etc.</p>

<p>The first attempts to assume friendship and love are
constellated in the strongest manner possible by the relation
to parents, and here one can usually observe how powerful
are the influences of the familiar constellations. It is not
rare, for instance, for a healthy man whose mother was
hysterical to marry a hysteric, or for the daughter of an
alcoholic to choose an alcoholic for her husband. I was once
consulted by an intelligent and educated young woman of
twenty-six who suffered from a peculiar symptom. She
thought that her eyes now and then took on a strange
expression which exerted a disagreeable influence on men.
If she then looked at a man he became self-conscious, turned
away and said something rapidly to his neighbour, at which
both were either embarrassed or inclined to laugh. The
patient was convinced that her look excited indecent thoughts
in the men. It was impossible to convince her of the falsity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of her conviction. This symptom immediately aroused in me
the suspicion that I dealt with a case of paranoia rather than
with a neurosis. But as was shown only three days later by
the further course of the treatment, I was mistaken, for the
symptom promptly disappeared after it had been explained
by analysis. It originated in the following manner: The
lady had a lover who deserted her in a very marked manner.
She felt utterly forsaken; she withdrew from all society and
pleasure, and entertained suicidal ideas. In her seclusion
there accumulated unadmitted and repressed erotic wishes
which she unconsciously projected on men whenever she was
in their company. This gave rise to the conviction that her
look excited erotic wishes in men. Further investigation
showed that her deserting lover was a lunatic, which she
had not apparently observed. I expressed my surprise at
her unsuitable choice, and added that she must have had
a certain predilection for loving mentally abnormal persons.
This she denied, stating that she had once before been engaged
to be married to a normal man. He, too, deserted her; and
on further investigation it was found that he, too, had been
in an insane asylum shortly before,&mdash;another lunatic! This
seemed to me to confirm with sufficient certainty my belief
that she had an unconscious tendency to choose insane
persons. Whence originated this strange taste? Her father
was an eccentric character, and in later years entirely estranged
from his family. Her whole love had therefore been turned
away from her father to a brother eight years her senior; him
she loved and honoured as a father, and this brother became
hopelessly insane at the age of fourteen. That was apparently
the model from which the patient could never free herself,
after which she chose her lovers, and through which she had
to become unhappy. Her neurosis which gave the impression
of insanity, probably originated from this infantile model.
We must take into consideration that we are dealing in this
case with a highly educated and intelligent lady, who did not
pass carelessly over her mental experiences, who indeed reflected
much over her unhappiness, without, however, having
any idea whence her misfortune originated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>There are things which unconsciously appear to us as a
matter of course, and it is for this reason that we do not see
them truly, but attribute everything to the so-called congenital
character. I could cite any number of examples of this kind.
Every patient furnishes contributions to this subject of the
determination of destiny through the influence of the familiar
milieu. In every neurotic we see how the constellation of
the infantile milieu influences not only the character of the
neurosis, but also life's destiny, even in its minute details.
The unhappy choice of a profession, and innumerable matrimonial
failures can be traced to this constellation. There
are, however, cases where the profession has been well
chosen, where the husband or wife leaves nothing to be
desired, and where still the person does not feel well but
works and lives under constant difficulties. Such cases often
appear under the guise of chronic neurasthenia. Here the
difficulty is due to the fact that the mind is unconsciously
split into two parts of divergent tendencies which are impeding
each other; one part lives with the husband or with
the profession, while the other lives unconsciously in the
past with the father or mother. I have treated a lady who,
after suffering many years from a severe neurosis, merged
into a dementia præcox. The neurotic affection began with
her marriage. This lady's husband was kind, educated, well
to do, and in every respect suitable for her; his character
showed nothing that would in any way interfere with a happy
marriage. The marriage was nevertheless unhappy, all congenial
companionship being excluded because the wife was
neurotic.</p>

<p>The important heuristic axiom of every psychoanalysis
reads as follows: <em>If a person develops a neurosis this neurosis
contains the counter-argument against the relation of the patient
to the individual with whom he is most intimately connected.</em>
A neurosis in the husband loudly proclaims that he has
intensive resistances and contrary tendencies against his wife;
if the wife has a neurosis she has a tendency which diverges
from her husband. If the person is unmarried the neurosis
is then directed against the lover or the sweetheart or against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the parents. Every neurotic naturally strives against this
relentless formulation of the content of his neurosis, and he
often refuses to recognise it at any cost, but still it is always
justified. To be sure, the conflict is not on the surface, but
must generally be revealed through a painstaking psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>The history of our patient reads as follows:</p>

<p>The father had a powerful personality. She was his
favourite daughter, and entertained for him a boundless
veneration. At the age of seventeen she for the first time
fell in love with a young man. At that time she twice
dreamt the same dream, the impression of which never
left her in all her later years; she even imputed a mystic
significance to it, and often recalled it with religious dread.
In the dream she saw a tall, masculine figure with a very
beautiful white beard; at this sight she was permeated
with a feeling of awe and delight as if she experienced the
presence of God Himself. This dream made the deepest
impression on her, and she was constrained to think of it
again and again. The love affair of that period proved to
be one of little warmth, and was soon given up. Later the
patient married her present husband. Though she loved her
husband she was led continually to compare him with her
deceased father; this comparison always proved unfavourable
to her husband. Whatever the husband said, intended, or
did, was subjected to this standard and always with the same
result: "My father would have done all this better and differently."
Our patient's life with her husband was not happy,
she could neither respect nor love him sufficiently; she was
inwardly dissatisfied. She gradually developed a fervent
piety, and at the same time violent hysterical symptoms
supervened. She began by going into raptures now over this
and now over that clergyman; she was looking everywhere
for a spiritual friend, and estranged herself more and more
from her husband. The mental trouble manifested itself
about ten years after marriage. In her diseased state she
refused to have anything to do with her husband and child;
she imagined herself pregnant by another man. In brief, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
resistances against her husband, which hitherto had been
laboriously repressed, came out quite openly, and among
other things manifested themselves in insults of the gravest
kind directed against him.</p>

<p>In this case we see how a neurosis appeared, as it were, at
the moment of marriage, <em>i.e. this neurosis expresses the counter-argument
against the husband</em>. What is the counter-argument?
The counter-argument is the father of the patient, for she
verified her belief daily that her husband was not the equal
of her father. When the patient first fell in love there had
appeared a symptom in the form of an extremely impressive
dream or vision. She saw the man with the very beautiful
white beard. Who was this man? On directing her attention
to the beautiful white beard she immediately recognised the
phantom. It was of course her father. Thus every time the
patient merged into a love affair the picture of her father
inopportunely appeared and prevented her from adjusting
herself psychologically to her husband.</p>

<p>I purposely chose this case as an illustration because it is
simple, obvious, and quite typical of many marriages which
are crippled through the neurosis of the wife. The cause of
the unhappiness always lies in a too firm attachment to the
parents. The infantile relationship has not been given up.
We find here one of the most important tasks of pedagogy,
namely, the solution of the problem how to free the growing
individual from his unconscious attachments to the influences
of the infantile milieu, in such a manner that he may retain
whatever there is in it that is suitable and reject whatever
is unsuitable. To solve this difficult question on the part of
the child seems to me impossible at present. We know as yet
too little about the child's emotional processes. The first and
only real contribution to the literature on this subject has in
fact appeared during the present year. It is the analysis of a
five-year-old boy published by Freud.</p>

<p>The difficulties on the part of the child are very great.
They should not, however, be so great on the part of the
parents. In many ways the parents could manage the love
of children more carefully, more indulgently, and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
intelligently. The sins committed against favourite children
by the undue love of the parents could perhaps be avoided
through a wider knowledge of the child's mind. For many
reasons I find it impossible to say anything of general validity
concerning the bringing up of children as it is affected by this
problem. We are as yet very far from general prescriptions
and rules; indeed we are still in the realm of casuistry.
Unfortunately, our knowledge of the finer mental processes
in the child is so meagre that we are not yet in any position
to say where the greatest trouble lies, whether in the parents,
in the child, or in the conception of the milieu. Only psychoanalyses
of the kind that Professor Freud has published in
the <cite>Jahrbuch</cite>, 1909,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> will help us out of this difficulty. Such
comprehensive and profound observations should act as a
strong inducement to all teachers to occupy themselves with
Freud's psychology. This psychology offers more values for
practical pedagogy than the physiological psychology of the
present.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Lecture III</span></p>

<p class="p3">EXPERIENCES CONCERNING THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: In our last lecture we saw how
important the emotional processes of childhood are for later
life. In to-day's lecture I should like to give you some
insight into the psychic life of the child through the analysis
of a four-year-old girl. It is much to be regretted that there
are few among you who have had the opportunity of reading
the analysis of "Little Hans" (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kleiner Hans</i>), which was
published by Freud during the current year.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> I ought to
begin by giving you the content of that analysis, so that you
might be in a position to compare Freud's results with those
obtained by me, and observe the marked, and astonishing
similarity between the unconscious creations of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
children. Without a knowledge of the fundamental analysis
of Freud, much in the report of the following case will
appear strange, incomprehensible, and perhaps unacceptable
to you. I beg you, however, to defer your final judgment
and to enter upon the consideration of these new subjects
with a kindly disposition, for such pioneer work in virgin
soil requires not only the greatest patience on the part of the
investigator, but also the unprejudiced attention of his
audience. Because the Freudian investigations apparently
involve a discussion of the most intimate secrets of sexuality
many people have had a feeling of repulsion against them,
and have therefore rejected everything as a matter of course
without any real disproof. This, unfortunately, has almost
always been the fate of Freud's doctrines up to the present.
One must not come to the consideration of these matters with
the firm conviction that they do not exist, for it may easily
happen that for the prejudiced they really do not exist. One
should perhaps assume the author's point of view for the
moment and investigate these phenomena under his guidance.
Only in this way can the correctness or otherwise of our
observations be affirmed. We may err, as all human beings
err. But the continual holding up to us of our mistakes&mdash;perhaps
they are worse than mistakes&mdash;does not help us to
see things more distinctly. We should prefer to see <em>wherein</em>
we err. That should be demonstrated to us in our own
sphere of experience. Thus far, however, no one has
succeeded in meeting us on our own ground, nor in giving us
a different conception of the things which we ourselves see.
We still have to complain that our critics persist in maintaining
complete ignorance about the matters in question.
The only reason for this is that they have never taken the
trouble to become thoroughly acquainted with our method;
had they done this they would have understood us.</p>

<p>The little girl to whose sagacity and intellectual vivacity
we are indebted for the following observations is a healthy,
lively child of emotional temperament. She has never been
seriously ill, and never, even in the realm of the nervous
system, had there been observed any symptoms prior to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
investigation. In the report which follows we shall have to
waive any connected description, for it is made up of anecdotes
which treat of one experience out of a whole cycle of similar
ones, and which cannot, therefore, be arranged scientifically
and systematically, but must rather be described somewhat
in the form of a story. We cannot as yet dispense with this
manner of description in our analytical psychology, for we
are still far from being able in all cases to separate with
unerring certainty what is curious from what is typical.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the little daughter, whom we will call Anna, was
about three years old, she once had the following conversation
with her grandmother:</p>

<blockquote><p>Anna: "Grandma, why are your eyes so dim?"</p>

<p>Grandma: "Because I am old."</p>

<p>A.: "But you will become young again."</p>

<p>G.: "No, do you know, I shall become older and older,
and then I shall die."</p>

<p>A.: "Well, and then?"</p>

<p>G.: "Then I shall be an angel."</p>

<p>A.: "And then will you be a little baby again?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The child found here a welcome opportunity for the provisional
solution of a problem. For some time before she had been in the
habit of asking her mother whether she would ever have a living
doll, a little child, a little brother. This naturally included the
question as to the origin of children. As such questions appeared only
spontaneously and indirectly, the parents attached no significance to
them, but responded to them as lightly and in appearance as carelessly
as the child seemed to ask them. Thus she once received from her father
the pretty story that children are brought by the stork. Anna had
already heard somewhere a more serious version, namely, that children,
are little angels living in heaven, and are brought from heaven by the
stork. This theory seems to have become the starting point for the
investigating activity of the little one. From the conversation with
the grandmother it could be seen that this theory was capable of wide
application, namely, it not only solved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in a comforting manner the painful idea of parting and dying, but at
the same time also the riddle of the origin of children. Such solutions
which kill at least two birds with one stone were formerly tenaciously
adhered to in science, and cannot be removed from the mind of the child
without a certain amount of shock.</p>

<p>Just as the birth of a little sister was the turning point in
the history of "Little Hans," so in this case it was the birth of a
brother, which happened when Anna had reached the age of four years.
The pregnancy of the mother apparently remained unnoticed; <i>i.e.</i>
the child never expressed herself on this subject. On the evening
before the birth, when labour pains were beginning, the child was in
her father's room. He took her on his knee and said, "Tell me, what
would you say if you should get a little brother to-night?" "I would
kill him" was the prompt answer. The expression "to kill" looks very
serious, but in reality it is quite harmless, for "to kill" and "to
die" in child language signify only to remove, either in the active or
in the passive sense, as has already been pointed out a number of times
by Freud. "To kill" as used by the child is a harmless word, especially
so when we know that the child uses the word "kill" quite promiscuously
for all possible kinds of destruction, removal, demolition, etc. It is,
nevertheless, worth while to note this tendency (see the analysis of
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kleiner Hans</i>, p. 5).</p>

<p>The birth occurred early in the morning, and later the father
entered the room where Anna slept. She awoke as he came in. He imparted
to her the news of the advent of a little brother, which she took with
surprise and strained facial expression. The father took her in his
arms and carried her into the lying-in room. She first threw a rapid
glance at her somewhat pale mother and then displayed something like a
mixture of embarrassment and suspicion as if thinking, "Now what else
is going to happen?" (Father's impression.) She displayed hardly any
pleasure at the sight of the new arrival, so that the cool reception
she gave it caused general disappointment. During the forenoon she kept
very noticeably away from her mother; this was the more striking as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
she was usually much attached to her. But once when her mother was
alone she ran into the room, embraced her and said, "Well, aren't you
going to die now?" Now a part of the conflict in the child's psyche
is revealed to us. Though the stork theory was never really taken
seriously, she accepted the fruitful re-birth hypothesis, according
to which a person by dying helps a child into life. Accordingly the
mother, too, must die; why, then, should the newborn child, against
whom she already felt childish jealousy, cause her pleasure? It was for
this reason that she had to seek a favourable opportunity of reassuring
herself as to whether the mother was to die, or rather was moved to
express the hope that she would not die.</p>

<p>With this happy issue, however, the re-birth theory sustained a
severe shock. How was it possible now to explain the birth of her
little brother and the origin of children in general? There still
remained the stork theory which, though never expressly rejected, had
been implicitly waived through the assumption of the re-birth theory.
The explanations next attempted unfortunately remained hidden from the
parents as the child went to stay with her grandmother for a few weeks.
From the latter's report the stork theory was often discussed, and was
naturally reinforced by the concurrence of those about her.</p>

<p>When Anna returned to her parents, she again, on meeting her mother,
evinced the same mixture of embarrassment and suspicion which she had
displayed after the birth. The impression, though inexplicable, was
quite unmistakable to both parents. Her behaviour towards the baby was
very nice. During her absence a nurse had come into the house who, on
account of her uniform, made a deep impression on Anna; to be sure, the
impression at first was quite unfavourable as she evinced the greatest
hostility to her. Thus nothing could induce her to allow herself to
be undressed and put to sleep by this nurse. Whence this resistance
originated was soon shown in an angry scene near the cradle of the
little brother in which Anna shouted at the nurse, "This is not your
little brother, he is mine!" Gradually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
however, she became reconciled to the nurse, and began to play nurse
herself; she had to have her white cap and apron, and "nursed" now her
little brother, and now her doll.</p>

<p>In contrast to her former mood she became unmistakably mournful and
dreamy. She often sat for a long time under the table singing stories
and making rhymes, which were partially incomprehensible but sometimes
contained the "nurse" theme ("I am a nurse of the green cross"). Some
of the stories, however, distinctly showed a painful feeling striving
for expression.</p>

<p>Here we meet with a new and important feature in the little one's
life: that is, we meet with reveries, even a tendency towards poetic
fancies and melancholic attacks. All of them things which we are wont
first to encounter at a later period of life, at a time when the
youth or maiden is preparing to sever the family tie and to enter
independently upon life, but is still held back by an inward, painful
feeling of homesickness for the warmth of the parental hearth. At
such a time the youth begins to replace what is lacking with poetic
fancies in order to compensate for the deficiency. To approximate the
psychology of a four-year-old child to that of the youth approaching
puberty will at first sight seem paradoxical; the relationship lies,
however, not in the age but rather in the mechanism. The elegiac
reveries express the fact that a part of that love which formerly
belonged, and should belong, to a real object, is now <em>introverted</em>,
that is, it is turned inward into the subject and there produces
an increased imaginative activity. What is the origin of this
<em>introversion</em>? Is it a psychological manifestation peculiar to this
age, or does it owe its origin to a conflict?</p>

<p>This is explained in the following occurrence. It often happened
that Anna was disobedient to her mother, she was insolent, saying, "I
am going back to grandma."</p>

<p>Mother: "But I shall be sad when you leave me."</p>

<p>Anna: "Oh, but you have my little brother."</p>

<p>This reaction towards the mother shows what the little one was
really aiming at with her threats to go away again; she apparently
wished to hear what her mother would say to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
her proposal, that is, to see what attitude her mother would actually
assume to her, whether her little brother had not ousted her altogether
from her mother's regard. One must, however, give no credence to
this little trickster. For the child could readily see and feel
that, despite the existence of the little brother, there was nothing
essentially lacking to her in her mother's love. The reproach to which
she subjects her mother is therefore unjustified, and to the trained
ear this is betrayed by a slightly affected tone. Such an unmistakable
tone does not expect to be taken seriously and hence it obtrudes itself
more vehemently. The reproach as such cannot be taken seriously by the
mother, for it was only the forerunner of other and this time more
serious resistances. Not long after the conversation narrated above,
the following scene took place:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mother: "Come, we are going into the garden now!"</p>

<p>Anna: "You are telling lies, take care if you are not telling the
truth."</p>

<p>M.: "What are you thinking of? I <em>am</em> telling the truth."</p>

<p>A.: "No, you are not telling the truth."</p>

<p>M.: "You will soon see that I am telling the truth: we are going
into the garden now."</p>

<p>A.: "Indeed, is that true? Is that really true? Are you not
lying?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Scenes of this kind were repeated a number of times. This time the
tone was more rude and more vehement, and at the same time the accent
on the word "lie" betrayed something special which the parents did not
understand; indeed, at first they attributed too little significance to
the spontaneous utterances of the child. In this they merely did what
education usually does in general, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex officio</i>. We usually pay little
heed to children in every stage of life; in all essential matters, they
are treated as not responsible, and in all unessential ma
tters, they are trained with an automatic
precision.</p>

<p>Under resistances there always lies a question, a conflict,
of which we hear later and on other occasions. But usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
one forgets to connect the thing heard with the resistances.
Thus, on another occasion, Anna put to her mother the following
questions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Anna: "I should like to become a nurse when I grow big&mdash;why did
you not become a nurse?"</p>

<p>Mother: "Why, as I have become a mother I have children to nurse
anyway."</p>

<p>A. (Reflecting): "Indeed, shall I be a lady like you, and shall I
talk to you then?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The mother's answer again shows whither the child's question was
really directed. Apparently Anna, too, would like to have a child to
"nurse" just as the nurse has. Where the nurse got the little child
is quite clear. Anna, too, could get a child in the same way if she
were big. Why did not the mother become such a nurse, that is to say,
how did she get a child if not in the same way as the nurse? Like
the nurse, Anna, too, could get a child, but how that fact might be
changed in the future or how she might come to resemble her mother in
the matter of getting children is not clear to her. From this resulted
the thoughtful question, "Indeed, shall I be a lady like you? Shall I
be quite different?" The stork theory evidently had come to naught,
the dying theory met a similar fate; hence she now thinks one may get
a child in the same way, as, for example, the nurse got hers. She,
too, could get one in this natural way, but how about the mother who
is no nurse and still has children? Looking at the matter from this
point of view, Anna asks: "Why did you not become a nurse?" namely,
"why have you not got your child in the natural way?" This peculiar
indirect manner of questioning is typical, and evidently corresponds
with the child's hazy grasp of the problem, unless we assume a
certain diplomatic uncertainty prompted by a desire to evade direct
questioning. We shall later find an illustration of this possibility.
Anna is evidently confronted with the question "Where does the child
come from?" The stork did not bring it; mother did not die; nor did
mother get it in the same way as the nurse. She has, however, asked
this question before and received the information from her father that
the stork brings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
children; this is positively untrue, she can never be deceived on
this point. Accordingly, papa and mama and all the others lie. This
readily explains her suspicion at the childbirth and her discrediting
of her mother. But it also explains another point, namely, the elegiac
reveries which we have attributed to a partial introversion. We know
now what was the real object from which love was removed and uselessly
introverted, namely, it had to be taken <em>from the parents</em> who deceived
her and refused to tell her the truth. (What can this be which must not
be uttered? What is going on here?) Such were the parenthetic questions
of the child, and the answer was: Evidently this must be something to
be concealed, perhaps something dangerous. Attempts to make her talk
and to draw out the truth by means of artful questions were futile,
so <em>resistance is placed against resistance</em>, and the introversion
of love begins. It is evident that the capacity for sublimation in a
four-year-old child is still too slightly developed to be capable of
performing more than symptomatic services. The mind, therefore, depends
on another compensation, namely, it resorts to one of the relinquished
infantile devices for securing love by force, preferably that of crying
and calling the mother at night. This had been diligently practised
and exhausted during her first year. It now returns, and corresponding
to the period of life has become well determined and equipped with
recent impressions. It was just after the earthquakes in Messina, and
this event was discussed at the table. Anna was extremely interested
in everything, she repeatedly asked her grandmother to tell her how
the earth shook, how the houses fell in and many people lost their
lives. After this she had nocturnal fears, she could not be alone, her
mother had to go to her and stay with her; otherwise she feared that an
earthquake would happen, that the house would fall and kill her. During
the day, too, she was much occupied with such thoughts. While walking
with her mother she annoyed her with such questions as, "Will the house
be standing when we return home? Are you sure there is no earthquake at
home? Will papa still be living?" About every stone lying in the road
she asked whether it was from an earthquake. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
building in course of erection was a house destroyed by the earthquake,
etc. Finally, she began to cry out frequently at night that the
earthquake was coming and that she heard the thunder. Each evening she
had to be solemnly assured that there was no earthquake coming.</p>

<p>Many means of calming her were tried, thus she was told, for
example, that earthquakes only occur where there are volcanoes. But
then she had to be satisfied that the mountains surrounding the city
were not volcanoes. This reasoning led the child by degrees to a desire
for learning, as strong as it was unnatural at her age, which showed
itself in a demand that all the geological atlases and text-books
should be brought to her from her father's library. For hours she
rummaged through these works looking for pictures of volcanoes and
earthquakes, and asking questions continually. Here we are confronted
by an energetic effort to sublimate the fear into an eager desire for
knowledge, which at this age made a decidedly premature exaction.
But how many a gifted child suffering in exactly the same way with
such problems, is "cosseted" through this untimely sublimation, by no
means to its advantage. For, by favouring sublimation at this age one
is merely strengthening manifestation of neurosis. The root of the
eager desire for knowledge is <em>fear</em>, and <em>fear is the expression of
converted libido</em>; that is, it is the expression of <em>an introversion
which has become neurotic</em>, which at this age is neither necessary nor
favourable for the development of the child.</p>

<p>Whither this eager desire for knowledge was ultimately directed is
explained by a series of questions which arose almost daily. "Why is
Sophie (a younger sister) younger than I?" "Where was Freddie (the
little brother) before? Was he in heaven? What was he doing there? Why
did he come down just now, why not before?"</p>

<p>This state of affairs led the father to decide that the mother
should tell the child when occasion offered <em>the truth concerning
the origin of the little brother</em>. This having been done, Anna soon
thereafter asked about the stork. Her mother told her that the story of
the stork was not true, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
that Freddie grew inside his mother like the flowers in a plant. At
first he was very little, and then he became bigger and bigger as a
plant does. She listened attentively without the slightest surprise,
and then asked, "But did he come out all by himself?"</p>

<blockquote><p>Mother: "Yes."</p>

<p>Anna: "But he cannot walk!"</p>

<p>Sophie: "Then he crawled out."</p></blockquote>

<p>Anna, overhearing her little sister's answer: "Is there a hole
here? (pointing to the breast) or did he come out of the mouth? Who
came out of the nurse?" She then interrupted herself and exclaimed,
"No, no, the stork brought baby brother down from heaven." She soon
left the subject and again wished to see pictures of volcanoes. During
the evening following this conversation she was calm. The sudden
explanation produced in the child a whole series of ideas, which
manifested themselves in certain questions. New unexpected perspectives
were opened; she rapidly approached the main problem, namely, the
question, "<em>Where did the baby come out?</em>" <em>Was it from a hole in the
breast or from the mouth?</em> Both suppositions are entirely qualified to
form acceptable theories. We even meet with recently married women who
still entertain the theory of the hole in the abdominal wall or of the
Cæsarean section; this is supposed to betray a very unusual degree of
innocence. But as a matter of fact it is not innocence; we are always
dealing in such cases with infantile sexual activities, which in later
life have brought the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vias naturales</i> into ill repute.</p>

<p>It may be asked where the child got the absurd idea that there is a
hole in the breast, or that the birth takes place through the mouth.
Why did she not select one of the natural openings existing in the
pelvis from which things come out daily? The explanation is simple.
Very shortly before, our little one had invoked some educational
criticism from her mother by a heightened interest in both openings
with their remarkable excretions,&mdash;an interest not always in
accord with the requirements of cleanliness and decorum. Then for the
first time she became acquainted with the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> exceptional laws
relating to these bodily regions and, being a sensitive child, she
soon learned that there was something here to be tabooed. This region,
therefore, must not be referred to. Anna had simply shown herself
docile and had so adjusted herself to the cultural demands that she
thought (at least spoke) of the simplest things last. The incorrect
theories substituted for correct laws sometimes persist for years until
brusque explanations come from without. It is, therefore, no wonder
that such theories, the forming of and adherence to which are favoured
even by parents and educationalists should later become determinants
for important symptoms in a neurosis, or of delusions in a psychosis,
just as I have shown that in dementia præcox<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> what has existed in
the mind for years always remains somewhere, though it may be hidden
under compensations of a seemingly different kind.</p>

<p>But even before this question was settled as to where the child
really comes out a new problem obtruded itself, viz. the children came
out of the mother, but how is it with the nurse? Did some one come out
of her too? This question was followed by the remark, "No, no, the
stork brought down baby brother from heaven." What is there peculiar
about the fact that nobody came out of the nurse? We recall that Anna
identified herself with the nurse, and planned to become a nurse later,
for she, too, would like to have a child, and she could have one as
well as the nurse. But now when it is known that the little brother
grew in mama, how is it now?</p>

<p>This disquieting question is averted by a quick return to the
stork-angel theory which has never been really believed and which after
a few trials is at last definitely abandoned. Two questions, however,
remain in the air. The first reads as follows: Where does the child
come out? The second, a considerably more difficult one, reads: How
does it happen that mama has children while the nurse and the servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
do not? All these questions did not at first manifest themselves.</p>

<p>On the day following the explanation, while at dinner, Anna
spontaneously remarked: "My brother is in Italy, and has a house of
cloth and glass, but it does not tumble down."</p>

<p>In this case, as in the others, it was impossible to ask for an
explanation; the resistances were too great and Anna could not be
drawn into conversation. This former officious and pretty explanation
is very significant. For some three months the two sisters had been
building a stereotyped fanciful conception of a "big brother." This
brother knows everything, he can do and has everything, he has been
and is in every place where the children are not; he is owner of great
cows, oxen, horses, dogs; everything is his, etc. Every one has such
a "big brother." We must not look far for the origin of this fancy;
the model for it is the <em>father</em> who seems to correspond to this
conception; he seems to be like a brother to mama. The children, too,
have their similar powerful "brother." This brother is very brave; he
is at present in dangerous Italy and inhabits an impossible fragile
house, and <em>it does not tumble down</em>. For the child this realises an
important wish: <em>the earthquake is no longer to be dangerous</em>; in
consequence <em>the child's fear disappeared and did not return</em>. The fear
of earthquakes now entirely vanished. Instead of calling her father to
her bed to conjure away the fear, she now became very affectionate and
begged him every night to kiss her.</p>

<p>In order to test this new state of affairs the father showed her
pictures illustrating volcanoes and earthquake devastations. Anna
remained unaffected, she examined the pictures with indifference,
remarking, "These people are dead; I have already seen that quite
often." The picture of a volcanic eruption no longer had any attraction
for her. Thus all her scientific interest collapsed and vanished as
suddenly as it came. During the days following the explanation Anna had
quite important matters to occupy herself with; she disseminated her
newly acquired knowledge among those about her in the following manner:
She began by again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
circumstantially affirming what had been told her, viz. that Freddy,
her younger sister, and herself had grown in her mother, that papa
and mama grew in their mothers, and that the servants likewise grew
in their respective mothers. By frequent questions she tested the
true basis of her knowledge, for her suspicion was aroused in no
small measure, so that it needed many confirmations to remove all her
uncertainties.</p>

<p>On one occasion the trustworthiness of the theory threatened to go
to pieces. About a week after the explanation, the father was taken
ill with influenza and had to remain in bed during the forenoon. The
children knew nothing about this, and Anna, coming into the parents'
bedroom, saw what was quite unusual, namely, that her father was
remaining in bed. She again took on a peculiar surprised expression;
she remained at a distance from the bed and would not come nearer; she
was apparently again reserved and suspicious. But suddenly she burst
out with the question, "Why are you in bed; have you a plant in your
inside too?"</p>

<p>The father naturally had to laugh. He calmed her, however, by
assuring her that children never grow in the father, that only women
can have children, and not men; thereupon the child again became
friendly. But though the surface was calm the problems continued to
work in the dark. A few days later, while at dinner, Anna related the
following dream: "I dreamed last night of Noah's ark." The father then
asked her what she had dreamed about it, but Anna's answer was sheer
nonsense. In such cases it is necessary only to wait and pay attention.
A few minutes later she said to her mother, "I dreamed last night about
Noah's ark, and there were a lot of little animals in it." Another
pause. She then began her story for the third time. "<em>I dreamed last
night about Noah's ark, and there were a lot of baby animals in it, and
underneath there was a lid and that opened and all the baby animals
fell out.</em>"</p>

<p>The children really had a Noah's ark, but its opening, a lid, was on
the roof and not underneath. In this way she delicately intimated that
the story of the birth from mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
or breast is incorrect, and that she had some inkling where the
children came out.</p>

<p>A few weeks then passed without any noteworthy occurrences. On one
occasion she related the following dream: "<em>I dreamed about papa and
mama; they had been sitting late in the study, and we children were
there too.</em>" On the face of this we find a wish of the children to be
allowed to sit up as long as the parents. This wish is here realised,
or rather it is utilised to express a more important wish, namely,
<em>to be present in the evening when the parents are alone</em>; of course,
quite innocently, it was in the <em>study</em> where she has seen all the
interesting books, and where she has satiated her thirst for knowledge;
<i>i.e.</i> she was really seeking an answer to the burning question, whence
the little brother came. If the children were there they would find out.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> A few days
later Anna had a terrifying dream from which she awoke crying, "The
earthquake is coming, the house has begun to shake." Her mother went to
her and calmed her by saying that the earthquake was not coming, that
everything was quiet, and that everybody was asleep. Whereupon Anna
said: "<em>I would like to see the spring, when all the little flowers are
coming out and the whole lawn is full of flowers; I would like to see
Freddy, he has such a dear little face. What is papa doing? What is he
saying?</em>" The mother said, "He is asleep, and isn't saying anything
now." Little Anna then remarked with a sarcastic smile: "<em>He will
surely be sick again to-morrow.</em>"</p>

<p>This text should be read backwards. The last sentence was not meant
seriously, as it was uttered in a mocking tone. When the father was
sick the last time, Anna suspected that he had a "plant in his inside."
The sarcasm signifies: "To-morrow papa is surely going to have a
child." But this also is not meant seriously. Papa is not going to have
a child; mama alone has children; perhaps she will have another child
to-morrow; but where from? "What does papa do?" The formulation of the
difficult problem seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
here to come to the surface. It reads: What does papa really do if
he does not bear children? The little one is very anxious to have a
solution for all these problems; she would like to know how Freddy came
into the world, she would like to see how the little flowers come out
of the earth in the spring, and these wishes are hidden behind the fear
of earthquakes.</p>

<p>After this intermezzo Anna slept quietly until morning. In the
morning her mother asked her what she had dreamed. She did not at first
recall anything, and then said: "<em>I dreamed that I could make the
summer, and then some one threw a Punch</em><a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> <em>down into the closet.</em>"</p>

<p>This peculiar dream apparently has two different scenes which are
separated by "then." The second part draws its material from the recent
wish to possess a Punch, that is, to have a boy doll just as mama has a
little boy. Some one threw Punch down into the closet; one often lets
other things fall down into the water closet. <em>It is just like this
that the children, too, come out.</em> We have here an analogy to the
"Lumpf-theory" of little Hans.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Whenever several scenes
are found in one dream, each scene ordinarily represents a particular
variation of the complex elaboration. Here accordingly the first part
is only a variation of the theme found in the second part. The meaning
of "to see the spring" or "to see the little flowers come out" we have
already remarked. Anna now dreams that she <em>can make the summer</em>, that
is she can bring it about that the little flowers shall come out. She
herself can make a little child, and the second part of the dream
represents this just as one makes a motion in the w.c. Here we find the
egoistic wish which is behind the seemingly objective interest of the
previous night's conversation.</p>

<p>A few days later the mother was visited by a lady who expected soon
to become a mother. The children seemed to take no interest in the
matter, but the next day they amused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
themselves with the following play which was directed by the elder
girl; they took all the newspapers they could find in their father's
paper-basket and stuffed them under their clothes, so that the
imitation was unmistakable. During the night little Anna had another
dream: "<em>I dreamed about a woman in the city; she had a very big
stomach.</em>" The chief actor in a dream is always the dreamer himself
under some definite aspect; thus the childish play of the day before is
fully solved.</p>

<p>Not long after, Anna surprised her mother with the following
performance: She stuck her doll under her clothes, then pulled it out
slowly head downwards, and at the same time remarked, "<em>Look, the
baby is coming out, now it is all out.</em>" By this means Anna tells her
mother, "You see, thus I apprehend the problem of birth. What do you
think of it? Is that right?" The play is really meant to be a question,
for, as we shall see later, this idea had to be officially confirmed.
That rumination on this problem by no means ended here, is shown by
the occasional ideas conceived during the following weeks. Thus she
repeated the same play a few days later with her Teddy Bear, who stands
in the relation of an especially beloved doll. One day, looking at a
rose, she said to her grandmother, "See, the rose is getting a baby."
As her grandmother did not quite understand her, she pointed to the
enlarged calyx and said, "Don't you see it is quite fat here?"</p>

<p>Anna once quarrelled with her younger sister, and the latter
exclaimed angrily, "I will kill you." Whereupon Anna answered, "When I
am dead you will be all alone; then you will have to pray to God for
a live baby." But the scene soon changed: Anna was the angel, and the
younger sister was forced to kneel before her and pray to her that
she should present to her a living child. In this way Anna became the
child-dispensing mother.</p>

<p>Oranges were once served at table. Anna impatiently
asked for one and said, "<em>I am going to take an orange and
swallow it all down into my stomach, and then I shall get a baby.</em>"
Who does not think here of fairy tales in which childless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
women become pregnant by swallowing fruit, fish, and similar
things?<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> In this way Anna sought to solve the problem
<em>how the children actually come into the mother</em>. She thus enters
into a formulation which hitherto had not been defined with so much
clearness. The solution follows in the form of an <em>analogy</em>, which is
quite characteristic of the archaic thinking of the child. (In the
adult, too, there is a kind of thinking by metaphor which belongs to
the stratum lying immediately below consciousness; dreams bring the
analogies to the surface; the same may be observed also in dementia
præcox.) In German as well as in numerous foreign fairy tales one
frequently finds such characteristic childish comparisons. Fairy tales
seem to be the myths of the child, and therefore contain among other
things the mythology which the child weaves concerning the sexual
processes. The spell of the fairy tale poetry, which is felt even by
the adult, is explained by the fact that some of the old theories
are still alive in our unconscious minds. We experience a strange,
peculiar and familiar feeling when a conception of our remotest youth
is again stimulated. Without becoming conscious it merely sends into
consciousness a feeble copy of its original emotional strength.</p>

<p>The problem how the child gets into the mother was difficult to
solve. As the only way of taking things into the body is through the
mouth, it could evidently be assumed that the mother ate something
like a fruit, which then grows inside her. But then comes another
difficulty, namely, it is clear enough what the mother produces, but it
is not yet clear what the father is good for.</p>

<p>What does the father do? Anna now occupied herself exclusively with
this question. One morning she ran into the parents' bedroom while they
were dressing, she jumped into her father's bed, lay face downwards,
kicked with her legs and called at the same time, "<em>Look! does papa do
that?</em>" The analogy to the horse of "little Hans" which raised such
disturbance with its legs, is very surprising.</p>

<p>With this last performance the problem seemed to be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
rest entirely, at least the parents found no opportunity to make any
pertinent observations. That the problem should come to a standstill
just here is not at all surprising, for this is really its most
difficult part. Moreover, we know from experience that not many
children go beyond these limits during the period of childhood. The
problem is almost too difficult for the childish mind, which still
lacks much knowledge necessary to its solution.</p>

<p>This standstill lasted about five months, during which no phobias
or other signs of complex-elaboration appeared. After this lapse of
time there appeared premonitory signs of some new incidents. Anna's
family lived at that time in the country near a lake where the mother
and children could bathe. As Anna was afraid to wade farther into the
water than knee-deep, her father once put her into the water, which led
to an outburst of crying. In the evening while going to bed Anna asked
her mother, "Do you not believe that father wanted to drown me?" A few
days later there was another outburst of crying. She continued to stand
in the gardener's way until he finally placed her in a newly dug hole.
Anna cried bitterly, and afterwards maintained that the gardener wished
to bury her. Finally she awoke during the night with fearful crying.
Her mother went to her in the adjoining room and quieted her. She had
dreamed that "a train passed and then fell in a heap."</p>

<p>This tallies with the "stage coach" of "little Hans." These
incidents showed clearly enough that fear was again in the air, <i>i.e.</i>
that a resistance had again arisen preventing transference to the
parents, and that therefore a great part of her love was converted
into fear. This time suspicion was not directed against the mother,
but against the father, who she was sure must know the secret, but
would never let anything out. What could the father be doing or keeping
secret? To the child this secret appeared as something dangerous,
so that she felt the worst might be expected from the father. (This
feeling of childish anxiety with the father as object we see again most
distinctly in adults, especially in dementia præcox, which lifts the
veil of obscurity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
from many unconscious processes, as though it were following
psychoanalytic principles.) It was for this reason that Anna came to
the apparently absurd conclusion that her father wanted to drown her.
At the same time her fear contained the thought that the <em>object of the
father had some relation to a dangerous action</em>. This stream of thought
is no arbitrary interpretation. Anna meanwhile grew a little older and
her interest in her father took on a special colouring which is hard to
describe. Language has no words to describe the quite unique kind of
tender curiosity which shone in the child's eyes.</p>

<p>Anna once took marked delight in assisting the gardener while he was
sowing grass, without apparently divulging the profound significance
of her play. About a fortnight later she began to observe with great
pleasure the young grass sprouting. On one of these occasions she asked
her mother the following question: "Tell me, how did the eyes grow into
the head?" The mother told her that she did not know. Anna, however,
continued to ask whether God or her papa could tell this? The mother
then referred her to her father, who might tell her how the eyes grew
into the head. A few days later there was a family reunion at tea. When
the guests had departed, the father remained at the table reading the
paper and Anna also remained. Suddenly approaching her father she said,
"Tell me, how did the eyes grow into the head?"</p>

<p>Father: "They did not grow into the head; they were there from the
beginning and grew with the head."</p>

<p>A.: "Were not the eyes planted?"</p>

<p>F.: "No, they grew in the head like the nose."</p>

<p>A.: "Did the mouth and the ears grow in the same way? and the hair,
too?"</p>

<p>F.: "Yes, they all grew in the same way."</p>

<p>A.: "And the hair, too? But the mousies came into the world naked.
Where was the hair before? Aren't there little seeds for it?"</p>

<p>F.: "No; you see, the hair really came out of little grains
which are like seeds, but these were already in the skin long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
before and nobody sowed them." The father was now getting concerned;
he knew whither the little one's thoughts were directed, but he did
not wish to overthrow, for the sake of a former false application, the
opportunely established seed-theory which she had most fortunately
gathered from nature; but the child spoke with an unwonted seriousness
which demanded consideration.</p>

<p>Anna (evidently disappointed, and in a distressed tone): "But how
did Freddy get into mama? Who stuck him in? and who stuck you into your
mama? Where did he come out from?"</p>

<p>From this sudden storm of questions the father chose the last for
his first answer. "Just think, you know well enough that Freddy is a
boy; boys become men and girls women. Only women and not men can have
children; now just think, where could Freddy come out from?"</p>

<p>A. (Laughs joyfully and points to her genitals): "Did he come out
here?"</p>

<p>Father: "Yes, of course, you certainly must have thought of this
before?"</p>

<p>A. (Overlooking the question): "But how did Freddy get into mama?
Did anybody plant him? Was the seed planted?"</p>

<p>This very precise question could no longer be evaded by the father.
He explained to the child, who listened with the greatest attention,
that the mother is like the soil and the father like the gardener; that
the father provides the seed which grows in the mother, and thus gives
origin to a baby. This answer gave extraordinary satisfaction; she
immediately ran to her mother and said, "Papa has told me everything,
now I know it all." She did not, however, tell what she knew.</p>

<p>The new knowledge was, however, put into play the following day.
Anna went to her mother and said, "Think, mama, papa told me how Freddy
was a little angel and was brought from heaven by a stork." The mother
was naturally surprised and said, "No, you are mistaken, papa surely
never told you such a thing!" whereupon the little one laughed and ran
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>This was apparently a mode of revenge. Her mother did not wish or
was not able to tell her how the eyes grew into the head, hence she did
not know how Freddy got into her. It was for this reason that she again
tried her with the old story.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I wish to impress firmly upon parents and educationists this
instructive example of child psychology. In the learned psychological
discussions on the child's psyche we hear nothing about those parts
which are so important for the health and naturalness of our children,
nor do we hear more about the child's emotions and conflicts; and yet
they play a most important rôle.</p>

<p>It very often happens that children are erroneously treated as
quite imprudent and irrational beings. Thus on indulgently remarking
to an intelligent father, whose four-year-old daughter masturbated
excessively, that care should be exercised in the presence of the child
who slept in the same room as the parents, I received the indignant
reply, "I can absolutely assure you that the child knows nothing about
sexual matters." This recalls that distinguished old neurologist who
wished to deny the attribute "sexual" to a childbirth phantasy which
was represented in a dreamy state.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a child evincing neurotic talent exaggerated by
neurosis may be urged on by solicitous parents. How easy and tempting
it would have been, <i>e.g.</i> in the present case, to admire, excite, and
develop prematurely the child's eager desire for learning, and thereby
develop an unnatural <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">blasé</i> state and a precociousness masking a
neurosis! In such cases the parents must look after their own complexes
and complex tendencies and not make capital out of them at the expense
of the child. The idea should be dismissed once for all that children
are to be held in bondage by their parents or that they are their toys.
They are characteristic and new beings. In the matter of enlightenment
on sexual things it can be affirmed that they suffer from the
preconceived opinion that the truth is harmful. Many neurologists are
of opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that even in grown-ups enlightenment on their own psychosexual
processes is harmful and even immoral. Would not the same persons
perhaps refuse to admit the existence of the genitals themselves?</p>

<p>One should not, however, go from this extreme of prudishness to the
opposite one, namely that of enlightenment <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à tout prix</i>, which may
turn out as foolish as it is disagreeable. In this matter I believe
much discretion is advisable; still if children come upon an idea, they
should be deceived no more than adults.</p>

<p>I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that I have shown you what complicated
psychic processes psychoanalytic investigation reveals in the child,
and how great is the significance of these processes for the mental
health as well as for the general psychic development of the child.
What I have been unable to show is the universal validity of these
observations. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to demonstrate
this, for I do not know myself how much of it is universally valid.
Only by accumulation of such observations and further penetration into
the problems broached shall we gain a complete insight into the laws
of psychical development. It is to be regretted that we are at present
still far from this goal. But I confidently hope that educators and
practical psychologists, whether physicians or deep-thinking parents,
will not leave us too long unassisted in this immensely important and
interesting field.</p>

<p class="p3">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FATHER IN THE
DESTINY OF THE INDIVIDUAL<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>


<p class="center"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ducunt volentem fata, nolentem trahunt.</i></p>

<p>Freud has pointed out in many places<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> with unmistakable
clearness that the psychosexual relationship of the child
towards his parents, particularly towards the father, possesses
an overwhelming importance in the content of any later
neurosis. This relationship is in fact the infantile channel <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par
excellence</i> in which the libido flows back<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> when it encounters
any obstacles in later years, thus revivifying long-forgotten dreams
of childhood. It is ever so in life when we draw back before too
great an obstacle&mdash;the menace of some severe disappointment or
the risk of some too far-reaching decision&mdash;the energy stored
up for the solution of the task flows back impotent; the by-streams
once relinquished as inadequate are again filled up. He who has missed
the happiness of woman's love falls back, as a substitute, upon some
gushing friendship, upon masturbation, upon religiosity; should he be a
neurotic he plunges still further back into the conditions of childhood
which have never been quite forsaken, to which even the normal is
fettered by more than one link&mdash;he returns to the relationship to
father and mother. Every psychoanalysis carried out at all thoroughly
shows this regression more or less plainly. One peculiarity which
stands out in the works and views of Freud is that the relationship
to the father is seen to possess an overwhelming importance. This
importance of the father in the moulding of the child's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
psycho-sexuality may also be discovered in a quite other and
remote field, in the investigation of the family.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The most
recent thorough investigations demonstrate the predominating
influence of the father often lasting for centuries. The mother
seems of less importance in the family.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> If this is true for
heredity on the physical side how much more should we expect from the
psychological influences emanating from the father? These experiences,
and those gained more particularly in an analysis carried out
conjointly with Dr. Otto Gross, have impressed upon me the soundness
of this view. The problem has been considerably advanced and deepened
by the investigations of my pupil, Dr. Emma Fürst, into familial
resemblances in the reaction-type.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Fürst made association
experiments on one hundred persons belonging to twenty-four families.
Of this extensive material, only the results in nine families and
thirty-seven persons (all uneducated) have been worked out and
published. But the painstaking calculations do already permit some
valuable conclusions. The associations are classified on the <span
class="smcap">Kræpelin-aschaffenburg</span> scheme as simplified
and modified by myself; the difference is then calculated between
each group of qualities of the subjects experimented upon and the
corresponding group of every other subject experimented upon. Thus
we finally get the differentiation of the mean in reaction-type. The
following is the result:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Non-related men differ among themselves by 5·9.<br />
Non-related women differ among themselves by 6·0.<br />
Related men differ among themselves by 4·1.<br />
Related women differ among themselves by 3·8.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Relatives, and especially related women, have therefore, on the
average, resemblance in reaction-type. This fact means that the
psychological adaptation of relatives differs but slightly.</p>

<p>An investigation into the various relationships gave the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The mean difference of the husband and wife amounts to 4·7. The mean
deviation of this mean is, however, 3·7, a very high figure, which
signifies that the mean figure 4·7 is composed of very heterogeneous
figures; there are married couples in whom the reaction type is very
close and others in whom it is very slight. On the whole, however,
father and son, mother and daughter stand remarkably close.</p>

<p>The difference between father and son amounts to 3·1.</p>

<p>The difference between mother and daughter amounts to 3·0.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few cases of married couples (where the
difference fell to 1·4) these are the lowest differences. In Fürst's
work there was a case where the difference between the forty-five
year old mother and her sixteen year old daughter was only 0·5.
But it was just in this case that the mother and daughter differed
from the father's type by 11·8. The father is a coarse, stupid
man, an alcoholic; the mother goes in for Christian Science. This
corresponds with the fact that mother and daughter exhibit an extreme
word-predicate type,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> which is, in my experience, important
semeiotically for the diagnosis of insufficiency in the sexual object.
The word-predicate type transparently applies an excessive amount of
emotion externally and displays emotions with the unconscious, but
nevertheless obvious, endeavour to awaken echoing emotions in the
experimenter. This view closely corresponds with the fact that in
Fürst's material the number of word-predicates increases with the age
of the subjects experimented upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact of the extreme similarity between the reaction-type of
the offspring and the parents is matter for thought. The association
experiment is nothing but a small section from the psychological
life of a man. At bottom daily life is nothing but an extensive and
many-varied association experiment; in essence we react in life just
as we do in the experiments. Although this truth is evident, still
it requires a certain consideration and limitation. Let us take as
an instance the case of the unhappy mother of forty-five years and
her unmarried daughter of sixteen. The extreme word-predicate type
of the mother is, without doubt, the precipitate of a whole life of
disappointed hopes and wishes. One is not in the least surprised at
the word-predicate type here. But the daughter of sixteen has really
not yet lived at all; her real sexual object has not yet been found,
and yet she reacts as if she were her mother with endless disillusions
behind her. She has <em>the mother's adaptation</em>, and in so far she is
identified with the mother. There is ample evidence that the mother's
adaptation must be attributed to her relationship to the father. But
the daughter is not married to the father and therefore does not
need this adaptation. She has taken it over from the influence of
her milieu, and later on will try to adapt herself to the world with
this <em>familial disharmony</em>. In so far as an ill-assorted marriage is
unsuitable, the adaptation resulting from it is unsuitable.</p>

<p>Clearly such a fate has many possibilities. To adapt herself to
life, this girl either will have to surmount the obstacles of her
familial milieu, or, unable to free herself from them, she <em>will
succumb to the fate to which such an adaptation predisposes</em> her. Deep
within, unnoticed by any one, there may go on a glossing over of the
infantile disharmony, or a development of the negative of the parents'
character, accompanied by hindrances and conflicts to which she herself
has no clue. Or, growing up, she will come into painful conflict with
that world of actualities to which she is so ill-adapted till one
stroke of fate after another gradually opens her eyes to the fact that
it is herself, infantile and maladjusted, that is amiss. The source of
infantile adaptation to the parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
is naturally the affective condition on both sides; the psycho-sexuality
of the parents on one side and that of the child on the other. It is a
kind of psychical infection; we know that it is not logical truth, but
affects and their psychical expressions<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
which are here the effective forces. It is these that, with the
power of the herd-instinct, press into the mind of the child, there
fashioning and moulding it. In the plastic years between one and five
there have to be worked out all the essential formative lines which
fit exactly into the parental mould. Psychoanalytic experience teaches
us that, as a rule, the first signs of the later conflict between the
parental constellation and individual independence, of the struggle
between repression and libido (Freud), occur before the fifth year.</p>

<p>The few following histories will show how this parental
constellation obstructs the adaptation of the offspring. It must
suffice to present only the chief events of these, that is the events
of sexuality.</p>

<p><em>Case 1.</em>&mdash;A well-preserved woman of 55; dressed poorly but
carefully in black with a certain elegance, the hair carefully dressed;
a polite, obviously affected manner, precise in speech, a devotee.
The patient might be the wife of a minor official or shopkeeper. She
informs me, blushing and dropping her eyes, that she is the divorced
wife of a common peasant. She has come to the hospital on account of
depression, night terrors, palpitations, slight nervous twitchings in
the arms, thus presenting the typical features of a slight climacteric
neurosis. To complete the picture, she adds that she suffers from
severe anxiety-dreams; in her dreams some man seems to be pursuing her,
wild animals attack her, and so on.</p>

<p>Her anamnesis begins with the family history. (So far as possible I
give her own words.) Her father was a fine, stately, rather corpulent
man of imposing appearance. He was very happy in his marriage, for her
mother <em>worshipped</em> him. He was a clever man, a master-mechanic, and held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
a dignified and honourable position. There were only two children,
the patient and an elder sister. The sister was the mother's, and the
patient her father's favourite. When the patient was five years old
the father died suddenly from a stroke, at the age of forty-two. The
patient felt herself very isolated and was from that time treated by
the mother and the elder sister as the Cinderella. She noticed clearly
enough that her mother preferred her sister to herself. Her mother
remained a widow, her respect for her husband being too great to allow
her to marry a second time. She preserved his memory "like a religious
cult" and brought up her children in this way.</p>

<p>Later on the sister married, relatively young; the patient did not
marry till twenty-four. She never cared for young men, they all seemed
insipid; her mind turned always to more mature men. When about twenty
she became acquainted with a stately gentleman rather over forty, to
whom she was much drawn. For various reasons the friendship was broken
off. At twenty-four she became acquainted with a widower who had two
children. He was a fine, stately, somewhat corpulent man, and had an
imposing presence, like her father; he was forty-four. She married him
and respected him enormously. The marriage was childless; the children
by the first marriage died from an infectious disease. After four years
of married life her husband also died. For eighteen years she remained
his faithful widow. But at forty-six (just before the menopause) she
experienced a great need of love. As she had no acquaintances she went
to a matrimonial agency and married the first comer, a peasant of some
sixty years who had been already twice divorced on account of brutality
and perverseness; the patient knew this before marriage. She remained
five unbearable years with him, when she also obtained a divorce. The
neurosis set in a little later.</p>

<p>No further discussion will be required for those with psychoanalytic
experience; the case is too obvious. For those unversed in
psychoanalysis let me point out that up to her forty-sixth year the
patient did but reproduce most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
faithfully the milieu of her earliest youth. The sexuality which
announced itself so late and so drastically, even here only led
to a deteriorated edition of the father-surrogate; to this she is
brought by this late-blossoming sexuality. Despite repression, the
neurosis betrays the ever-fluctuating eroticism of the aging woman
who still wants to please (affectation) but dares not acknowledge her
sexuality.</p>

<p><em>Case 2.</em>&mdash;A man of thirty-four of small build and with a
sensible, kindly expression. He is easily embarrassed, blushes often.
He came for treatment on account of "nervousness." He says he is very
irritable, readily fatigued, has nervous indigestion, is often deeply
depressed so that he has thought of suicide.</p>

<p>Before coming to me for treatment he sent me a circumstantial
autobiography, or rather a history of his illness, in order to prepare
me for his visit. His story began: "My father was a very big and strong
man." This sentence awakened my curiosity; I turned over a page and
there read: "When I was fifteen a big lad of nineteen took me into the
wood and indecently assaulted me."</p>

<p>The numerous gaps in the patient's story induced me to obtain a
more exact anamnesis from him, which produced the following remarkable
facts.</p>

<p>The patient is the youngest of three brothers. His father, a big,
red-haired man, was formerly a soldier in the Papal Swiss Guard, and
then became a policeman. He was a strict, gruff old soldier, who
brought up his sons with military precision; he commanded them, did
not call them by name, but whistled to them. He had spent his youth in
Rome, where he acquired syphilis, from the consequences of which he
still suffered in old age. He was fond of talking about his adventures
in early life. His eldest son (considerably older than the patient) was
exactly like him, he was big, strong and had reddish hair. The mother
was a feeble woman, prematurely aged; exhausted and tired of life, she
died at forty when the patient was eight years old. He preserved a
tender and beautiful memory of his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>When he went to school he was always the whipping-boy and always the
object of his schoolfellows' mockery. The patient considers that his
peculiar dialect was to blame for this. Later he was apprenticed to a
severe and unkind master, under most trying conditions, from which all
the other apprentices had run away, finding them intolerable. Here he
held out for over two years. At fifteen the assault already mentioned
took place, in addition to some other slighter homosexual experiences.
Then fate sent him to France. There he made the acquaintance of a man
from the South of France, a great boaster and Don Juan. He dragged
the patient into a brothel; he went unwilling and out of fear. He
was impotent there. Later he went to Paris, where his brother, a
master-mason, the replica of his father, was leading a dissolute
life. There the patient remained a long time, badly paid and helping
his sister-in-law out of pity. The brother often took him along to
a brothel, where the patient was always impotent. Here the brother
asked him to make over to him his inheritance, 6000 francs. He first
consulted his second brother, who was also in Paris, who urgently
tried to dissuade him from giving the money to his brother, because
it would only be squandered. Nevertheless the patient gave his all to
his brother, who indeed soon squandered it. And the second brother,
who would have dissuaded him, was also let in for 500 francs. To my
astonished question why he had so light-heartedly given the money to
his brother without any guarantee, he replied: he had asked for it, he
was not a bit sorry about the money; he would give him another 6000
francs if he had it. The eldest brother came to grief altogether and
his wife divorced him. The patient returned to Switzerland and remained
for a year without regular employment, often suffering from hunger.
During this time he made the acquaintance of a family where he became a
frequent visitor. The husband belonged to some peculiar sect; he was a
hypocrite and neglected his family. The wife was elderly, ill and weak,
and moreover pregnant. There were six children and great poverty. The
patient developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
warm affection for this woman and divided with her the little he
possessed. She brought him her troubles, and said she felt sure she
would die in childbed. Then he promised her (he who possessed nothing)
to take charge of the children himself and bring them up. The wife
did die in childbed. The orphanage-board interfered, however, and
allowed him only one child. So he had a child but no family, and
naturally could not bring it up by himself. He thus came to think of
marrying. But as he had never been in love with any woman he was in
great perplexity. It then occurred to him that his elder brother was
divorced from his wife, and he resolved to marry her. He wrote his
intention to her in Paris. She was seventeen years older than he, but
not disinclined to the plan. She invited him to come to Paris to talk
matters over. On the eve of this journey fate, however, willed that he
should run a big iron nail into his foot so that he could not travel.
After a little while, when the wound was healed, he went to Paris, and
found that he had imagined his sister-in-law, and now his <em>fiancée</em>, to
be younger and prettier than she really was. The wedding took place,
and three months later the first coitus, at his wife's initiative. He
himself had no desire for it. They brought up the child together, he in
the Swiss and she in the French way, for she was a French woman. At the
age of nine the child was run over and killed by a cyclist. The patient
then felt very lonely and dismal at home. He proposed to his wife that
she should adopt a young girl, whereupon she broke out into a fury of
jealousy. Then for the first time he fell in love with a young girl,
whilst at the same time the neurosis started, with deep depression
and nervous exhaustion, for meanwhile his life at home had become a
hell.</p>

<p>My proposition to separate from his wife was refused out of hand,
because he could not take upon himself to make the old woman unhappy on
his account. He clearly prefers to be tormented still further; for it
would seem that the recollection of his youth is more precious to him
than any present joys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>In this case also the whole movement of a life takes place in the
magic circle of the familial constellation. The relation to the father
is the strongest and most momentous issue; its masochistic homosexual
colouring stands out clearly everywhere. Even the unhappy marriage is
determined in every way through the father, for the patient marries
the divorced wife of his eldest brother, which <em>is as if</em>
he married his mother. His wife is also the representative of the
mother-surrogate, of the friend who died in childbed.</p>

<p>The neurosis started at the moment when the libido had obviously
withdrawn from this relationship of infantile constellation, and
approached, for the first time, the sexual end determined by
the individual. In this, as in the previous case, the familial
constellation proves to be by far the stronger; the narrow field
vouchsafed by a neurosis is all that remains for the display of
individuality.</p>

<p><em>Case 3.</em>&mdash;A thirty-six year old peasant woman, of average
intelligence, healthy appearance and robust build, mother of three
healthy children. Comfortable family circumstances. Patient comes to
the hospital for treatment for the following reasons: for some weeks
she has been terribly wretched and anxious, has been sleeping badly,
has terrifying dreams, and suffers also during the day from anxiety and
depression. All these things are admittedly without foundation, she
herself is surprised at them, and must admit her husband is perfectly
right when he insists they are all "stuff and nonsense." All the same
she cannot get away from them. Strange ideas come to her too; she is
going to die and is going to hell. She gets on very well with her
husband.</p>

<p>The psychoanalytic examination of the case immediately brought the
following: some weeks before, she happened to take up some religious
tracts which had long lain about the house unread. There she read that
<em>swearers</em> would go to hell. She took this very much to heart, and
has since thought it incumbent on her to prevent people swearing or
she herself will go to hell. About a fortnight before she read these
tracts, her father, who lived with her, suddenly died from a stroke.
She was not actually present at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
death, but arrived when he was already dead. Her terror and grief were
very great.</p>

<p>In the days following the death she thought much about it all,
wondering why her father had to meet his end so abruptly. In the midst
of such meditations it suddenly occurred to her that the last words she
had heard her father say were: "I also am one of those who have fallen
from the cart into the devil's clutches." The remembrance filled her
with grief, and she recalled how often her father had sworn savagely.
She wondered then whether there really were a life after death, and
whether her father were in heaven or hell. During these musings she
came across the tracts and began to read them, getting to the place
where it said that swearers go to hell. Then came upon her great fear
and terror; she overwhelmed herself with reproaches, she ought to have
stopped her father's swearing, deserved punishment for her neglect.
She would die and would be condemned to hell. Henceforth she was full
of sorrow, moody, tormented her husband with this obsessive idea, and
renounced all joy and happiness.</p>

<p>The patient's life-history (reproduced partly in her own words) is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>She is the youngest of five brothers and sisters and was always her
<em>father's favourite</em>. The father gave her everything she wanted if he
possibly could. For instance, if she wanted a new dress and her mother
refused it, she could be sure her father would bring her one next time
he went to town. The mother died rather early. At twenty-four the
patient married the man of her choice, <em>against her father's wishes</em>.
The father simply disapproved of her choice although he had nothing
particular against the man. After the wedding she made her father come
and live with them. That seemed a matter of course, she said, since the
other relations had never suggested having him with them. The father
was a quarrelsome swearer and drunkard. Husband and father-in-law, as
may easily be imagined, got on extremely badly together. The patient
would always meekly fetch her father spirits from the inn, although
this gave rise perpetually to anger and altercations. But she finds her
husband "all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
right." He is a good, patient fellow with only one failing: he does
not obey her father enough; she finds that incomprehensible, and would
rather have her husband knuckle under to her father. All said and done,
father is still father. In the frequent quarrels she always took her
father's part. But she has nothing to say against her husband and he is
usually right in his protests, but <em>one must help one's father</em>.</p>

<p>Soon it began to seem to her that she had sinned against her father
by marrying against his will, and she often felt, after one of these
incessant wrangles, that her love for her husband had quite vanished.
And since her father's death it is impossible to love her husband any
longer, for his disobedience was the most frequent occasion of her
father's fits of raging and swearing. At one time the quarrelling
became too painful for the husband, and he induced his wife to find
rooms for her father elsewhere, where he lived for two years. During
this time husband and wife lived together peaceably and happily. But by
degrees the patient began to reproach herself for letting her father
live alone; in spite of everything he was her father. And in the end,
despite the husband's protests, she fetched him home again because, as
she said, in truth she did love her father better than her husband.
Scarcely was the old man back in the house before strife was renewed.
And so it went on till the father's sudden death.</p>

<p>After this recital she broke out into a whole series of
lamentations: she must separate from her husband: she would have done
it long ago if it were not for the children. She had indeed done an
ill-deed, committed a very great sin when she married her husband
against her father's wish. She ought to have taken the man whom her
father had wanted her to have. He certainly would have obeyed her
father and then everything would have been right. Oh, her husband was
not by a long way so kind as her father, she could do anything with her
father, but not with her husband. Her father had given her everything
she wanted. <em>Now she would best of all like to die, so that she might
be with her father.</em></p>

<p>When this outburst was over, I inquired eagerly on what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
grounds she had refused the husband her father had suggested to her.</p>

<p>The father, a small peasant on a lean little farm, had taken as a
servant, just at the time when his youngest daughter came into the
world, a miserable little boy, a foundling. The boy developed in most
unpleasant fashion: he was so stupid that he could not learn to read
or write or even speak quite properly. He was an absolute idiot. As he
approached manhood there developed on his neck a series of ulcers, some
of which opened and continually discharged pus, giving such a dirty,
ugly creature a horrible appearance. His intelligence did not grow with
his years, so he stayed on as servant in the peasant's house without
any recognised wage.</p>

<p><em>To this youth the father wanted to marry his favourite
daughter.</em></p>

<p>The girl, fortunately, had not been disposed to yield, but now she
regretted it, since this idiot would unquestionably have been more
obedient to her father than her good man had been.</p>

<p>Here, as in the foregoing case, it must be clearly understood
that the patient is not at all weak-minded. Both possess normal
intelligence, which unfortunately the blinkers of the infantile
constellation prevent their using. That appears with quite remarkable
clearness in this patient's life-story. The father's authority is never
questioned! It makes not the least difference that he is a quarrelsome
drunkard, the obvious cause of all the quarrels and disturbances; on
the contrary, the lawful husband must give way to the bogey, and at
last our patient even comes to regret that her father did not succeed
in completely destroying her life's happiness. So now she sets about
doing that herself through her neurosis, which compels in her the wish
to die, that she may go to hell, whither, be it noted, the father has
already betaken himself.</p>

<p>If we are ever disposed to see some demonic power at work
controlling mortal destiny, surely we can see it here in these
melancholy silent tragedies working themselves out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
slowly, torturingly, in the sick souls of our neurotics. Some, step
by step, continually struggling against the unseen powers, do free
themselves from the clutches of the demon who forces his unsuspecting
victims from one savage mischance to another: others rise up and win
to freedom, only to be dragged back later to the old paths, caught in
the noose of the neurosis. You cannot even maintain that these unhappy
people are neurotic or "degenerates." If we normal people examine our
lives from the psychoanalytic standpoint, we too perceive how a mighty
hand guides us insensibly to our destiny and not always is this hand a
kindly one.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> We
often call it the hand of God or of the Devil, for the power of the
infantile constellation has become mighty during the course of the
centuries in affording support and proof to all the religions.</p>

<p>But all this does not go so far as to say that we must cast the
blame of inherited sins upon our parents. A sensitive child whose
intuition is only too quick in reflecting in his own soul all the
excesses of his parents must lay the blame for his fate on his own
characteristics. But, as our last case shows, this is not always so,
for the parents can (and unfortunately only too often do) fortify the
evil in the child's soul, preying upon the child's ignorance to make
him the slave of their complexes. In our case this attempt on the part
of the father is quite obvious. It is perfectly clear why he wanted to
marry his daughter to this brutish creature: <em>he wanted to keep her and
make her his slave for ever</em>. What he did is but a crass exaggeration
of what is done by thousands of so-called respectable, educated people,
who have their own share in this educational dust-heap of enforced
discipline. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
fathers who allow their children no independent possession of their own
emotions, who fondle their daughters with ill-concealed eroticism and
tyrannical passion, who keep their sons in leading-strings, force them
into callings and finally marry them off "suitably," and the mothers
who even in the cradle excite their children with unhealthy tenderness,
later on make them into slavish puppets, and then at last, out of
jealousy, destroy their children's love-life fundamentally, they all
act not otherwise than this stupid and brutal boor.</p>

<p>It will be asked, wherein lies the parents' magic power to bind
their children to themselves, as with iron fetters, often for the whole
of their lives? The psychoanalyst knows that it is nothing but the
sexuality on both sides.</p>

<p>We are always trying not to admit the child's sexuality. That view
only comes from wilful ignorance, which happens to be very prevalent
again just now.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>I have not given any real analysis of these cases. We therefore do
not know what happened within the hearts of these puppets of fate when
they were children. A profound insight into a child's mind as it grows
and lives, hitherto unattainable, is given in Freud's contribution to
the first half-yearly volume of <cite>Jahrbuch für Psychoanalytische u.
Psychopathologische Forschungen</cite>. If I venture, after Freud's masterly
presentation, to offer another small contribution to the study of the
child-mind it is because the psychoanalytic records of cases seem to me
always valuable.</p>

<p><em>Case 4.</em>&mdash;An eight year old boy, intelligent, rather
delicate-looking, is brought to me by his mother, on account of
enuresis. During the consultation the child always hangs on to his
mother, a pretty, youthful woman. The parents'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
marriage is a happy one, but the father is strict, and the boy
(the eldest child) is rather afraid of him. The mother compensates
for the father's strictness by corresponding tenderness, to which
the boy responds so much that he never gets away from his mother's
apron-strings. He never plays with his schoolfellows, never goes alone
into the street unless he has to go to school. He fears the boys'
roughness and violence and plays thoughtful games at home or helps his
mother with housework. He is extremely jealous of his father. He cannot
bear it when the father shows tenderness to the mother.</p>

<p>I took the boy aside and asked him about his dreams.</p>

<p>He dreams very often of a <em>black snake</em> which <em>wants to bite his
face</em>. Then he cries out, and his mother has to come from the next room
to his bedside.</p>

<p>In the evening he goes quietly to bed. But when he falls asleep it
seems to him that a wicked <em>black man with a sabre or gun lies on his
bed</em>&mdash;<em>a tall, thin man who wants to kill him</em>.</p>

<p>His parents sleep in the adjoining room. It often seems to him that
something dreadful is going on there, as if there are great <em>black
snakes or wicked men who want to kill his Mamma</em>. Then he has to cry
out and his mother comes to comfort him.</p>

<p>Every time he wets his bed he calls his mother, who has to settle
him down again in dry things.</p>

<p>The father is a tall thin man. Every morning he stands at the
washstand naked in full view of the child, to perform a thorough
ablution. The child also tells me that at night he is often suddenly
waked from sleep by a strange sound in the next room; then he is always
horribly afraid as if something dreadful were going on in there, some
struggle&mdash;but his mother quiets him, says there's nothing to be
afraid of.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to see whence comes the black snake and who the
wicked man is, and what is happening in the next room. It is equally
easy to understand the boy's aim when he calls out for his mother: he
is jealous and separates her from the father. This he does also in the
daytime whenever he sees his father caressing her. So far the boy is
simply his father's rival for his mother's love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>But now comes the circumstance that the snake and the bad man also
threaten him, there happens to him the same thing as to his mother in
the next room. Thus he identifies himself with his mother and proposes
a similar relationship for himself with his father. That is owing to
his homosexual component which feels like a woman towards the father.
What enuresis signifies in this case is, from the Freudian standpoint,
not difficult to understand. The micturition dream throws light upon
it. Let me refer to an analysis of the same kind in my article:
"L'analyse des rêves, Année psychologique" (1909). Enuresis must be
regarded as an infantile sex-surrogate; in the dream-life of adults too
it is easily used as a cloak for the urge of sexual desire.</p>

<p>This little example shows what goes on in the mind of an eight year
old boy, when he is in a position of too much dependence upon his
parents, but the blame is also partly due to the too strict father and
the too indulgent mother.</p>

<p>The infantile attitude here, it is evident, is nothing but infantile
sexuality. If now we survey all the far-reaching possibilities of the
infantile constellation, we are forced to say that <em>in essence our
life's fate is identical with the fate of our sexuality</em>. If Freud and
his school devote themselves first and foremost to tracing out the
individual's sexuality it is certainly not in order to excite piquant
sensations, but to gain a deeper insight into the driving forces that
determine that individual's fate. In this we are not saying too much,
rather understating the case. If we can strip off the veils shrouding
the problems of individual destiny, we can afterwards widen our view
from the history of the individual to the history of nations. And
first of all we can look at the history of religions, at the history
of the phantasy-systems of whole peoples and epochs. The religion of
the Old Testament elevated the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">paterfamilias</i> to the Jehovah of the
Jews whom the people had to obey in fear and dread. The Patriarchs are
an intermediate stage towards the deity. The neurotic fear and dread
of the Jewish religion, the imperfect, not to say unsuccessful attempt
at the sublimation of a still too barbarous people, gave rise to the
excessive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
severity of the Mosaic Law, the ceremonial constraint of the
neurotic.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Only the prophets succeeded in freeing themselves from this
constraint; in them the identification with Jehovah, the complete
sublimation, is successful. They became the fathers of the people.
Christ, the fulfilment of prophecy, put an end to this fear of God
and taught mankind that the true relation to the Godhead is "love."
Thus he destroyed the ceremonial constraint of the Law and gave the
example of a personal loving relationship to God. The later imperfect
sublimation of the Christian Mass leads again to the ceremonial of the
Church from which occasionally the minds capable of sublimation among
the saints and reformers have been able to free themselves. Not without
cause therefore does modern theology speak of "inner" or "personal"
experiences as having great enfranchising power, for always the ardour
of love transmutes the dread and constraint into a higher, freer type
of feeling.</p>

<p>What we see in the development of the world-process, the original
source of the changes in the Godhead, we see also in the individual.
Parental power guides the child like a higher controlling fate. But
when he begins to grow up, there begins also the conflict between the
infantile constellation and the individuality, the parental influence
dating from the prehistoric (infantile) period is repressed, sinks into
the unconscious but is not thereby eliminated; by invisible threads it
directs the individual creations of the ripening mind as they appear.
Like everything that has passed into the unconscious, the infantile
constellation sends up into consciousness dim, foreboding feelings,
feelings of mysterious guidance and opposing influences. Here are the
roots of the first religious sublimations. In the place of the father,
with his constellating virtues and faults, there appears, on the one
hand, an altogether sublime deity, on the other the devil, in modern
times for the most part largely whittled away by the perception of
one's own moral responsibility. Elevated love is attributed to the
former, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
lower sexuality to the latter. As soon as we approach the territory
of the neurosis, the antithesis is stretched to the utmost limit. God
becomes the symbol of the most complete sexual repression, the Devil
the symbol of sexual lust. Thus it is that the conscious expression
of the father-constellation, like every expression of an unconscious
complex when it appears in consciousness, gets its Janus-face, its
positive and its negative components. A curious, beautiful example of
this crafty play of the unconscious is seen in the love-episode in the
Book of Tobias. Sarah, the daughter of Raguel in Ecbatana, desires to
marry; but her evil fate wills it that seven times, one after another,
she chooses a husband who dies on the marriage-night. The evil spirit
Asmodi, by whom she is persecuted, kills these husbands. She prays to
Jehovah to let her die rather than suffer this shame again. She is
despised even by her father's maid-servants. The eighth bridegroom,
Tobias, is sent to her by God. He too is led into the bridal-chamber.
Then the old Raguel, who has only pretended to go to bed, gets up again
and goes out and digs his son-in-law's grave beforehand, and in the
morning sends a maid to the bridal-chamber to make sure of the expected
death. But this time Asmodi's part is played out, Tobias is alive.</p>

<p>Unfortunately medical etiquette forbids me to give a case of
hysteria which fits in exactly with the above instance, except that
there were not seven husbands, but only three, ominously chosen under
all the signs of the infantile constellation. Our first case too comes
under this category and in our third we see the old peasant at work
preparing to dedicate his daughter to a like fate.</p>

<p>As a pious and obedient daughter (compare her beautiful prayer
in chapter iii.) Sarah has brought about the usual sublimation and
cleavage of the father-complex and on the one side has elevated her
childish love to the adoration of God, on the other has turned the
obsessive force of her father's attraction into the persecuting demon
Asmodi. The legend is so beautifully worked out that it displays the
father in his twofold aspect, on the one hand as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
inconsolable father of the bride, on the other as the secret digger
of his son-in-law's grave, whose fate he foresees. This beautiful
fable has become a cherished paradigm for my analysis, for by no means
infrequent are such cases where the father-demon has laid his hand upon
his daughter, so that her whole life long, even when she does marry,
there is never a true union, because her husband's image never succeeds
in obliterating the unconscious and eternally operative infantile
father-ideal. This is valid not only for daughters, but equally for
sons. A fine instance of such a father-constellation is given in Dr.
Brill's recently published: "Psychological factors in dementia præcox.
An analysis."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>In my experience the father is usually the decisive and dangerous
object of the child's phantasy, and if ever it happens to be the
mother, I have been able to discover behind her a grandfather to whom
she belonged in her heart.</p>

<p>I must leave this question open: my experience does not go far
enough to warrant a decision. It is to be hoped that the experience
of the coming years will sink deeper shafts into this still dark land
which I have been able but momentarily to light up, and will discover
to us more of the secret workshop of that fate-deciding demon of whom
Horace says:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="p3">A CONTRIBUTION TO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF
RUMOUR<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>


<p>About a year ago the school authorities in N. asked me to give a
professional opinion as to the mental condition of Marie X., a thirteen
year old schoolgirl. Marie had been expelled from school because she
had been instrumental in originating an ugly rumour, spreading gossip
about her class-teacher. The punishment hit the child, and especially
her parents, very hard, so that the school authorities were inclined
to readmit her if protected by a medical opinion. The facts were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The teacher had heard indirectly that the girls were attributing
some equivocal sexual story to him. On investigation it was found that
Marie X. had one day related a dream to three girl-friends which ran
somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The class was going to the swimming-baths. I had to go to the boys'
because there was no more room. Then we swam a long way out in the lake
(asked 'who did so': 'Lina P., the teacher, and myself'). A steamer
came along. The teacher asked us if we wished to get into it. We came
to K. A wedding was just going on there (asked 'whose': 'a friend of
the teacher's'). We were also to take part in it. Then we went for a
journey (who? 'I, Lina P., and the teacher'). It was like a honeymoon
journey. We came to Andermatt, and there was no more room in the hotel,
so we were obliged to pass the night in a barn. The woman got a child
there, and the teacher became the godfather."</p>

<p>When I examined the child she told this dream. The teacher had
likewise related the dream in writing. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
earlier version the obvious blanks after the word "steamer" in the
above text were filled up as follows: "We got up. Soon we felt cold. An
old man gave us a blouse which the teacher put on." On the other hand,
there was an omission of the passage about finding no room in the hotel
and being obliged to pass the night in the barn.</p>

<p>The child told the dream immediately, not only to her three friends
but also to her mother. The mother repeated it to me with only trifling
differences from the two versions given above. The teacher, in his
further investigations, carried out with deepest misgivings, failed,
like myself, to get indications of any more dangerous material. There
is therefore a strong probability that the original recital could not
have run very differently. (The passage about the cold and the blouse
seems to be an early interpolation, for it is an attempt to supply a
logical relationship. Coming out of the water one is wet, has on only a
bathing dress, and is therefore unable to take part in a wedding before
putting on some clothes.) At first, of course, the teacher would not
allow that the whole affair had arisen only out of a dream. He rather
suspected it to be an invention. He was, however, obliged to admit
that the innocent telling of the dream was apparently a fact, and that
it was unnatural to regard the child as capable of such guile as to
indicate some sexual equivocation in this disguised form. For a time he
wavered between the view that it was a question of cunning invention,
and the view that it was really a question of a dream, innocent in
itself, which had been understood by the other children in a sexual
way. When his first indignation wore off he concluded that Marie X.'s
guilt could not be so great, and that her phantasies and those of her
companions had contributed to the rumour. He then did something really
valuable. He placed Marie's companions under supervision, and made them
all write out what they had heard of the dream.</p>

<p>Before turning our attention to this, let us cast a glance
at the dream analytically. In the first place, we must accept
the facts and agree with the teacher that we have to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
a dream and not with an invention; for the latter the ambiguity is
too great. Conscious invention tries to create unbroken transitions;
the dream takes no account of this, but sets to work regardless of
gaps, which, as we have seen, here give occasion for interpolations
during the conscious revision. The gaps are very significant. In the
swimming-bath there is no picture of undressing, being unclothed,
nor any detailed description of their being together in the water.
The omission of being dressed on the ship is compensated for by
the above-mentioned interpolation, but only for the teacher, thus
indicating that his nakedness was in most urgent need of cover. The
detailed description of the wedding is wanting, and the transition from
the steamer to the wedding is abrupt. The reason for stopping overnight
in the barn at Andermatt is not to be found at first. The parallel to
this is, however, the want of room in the swimming-bath, which made
it necessary to go into the men's department; in the hotel the want
of room again emphasises the separation of the sexes. The picture of
the barn is most insufficiently filled out. The birth suddenly follows
and quite without sequence. The teacher as godfather is extremely
equivocal. Marie's rôle in the whole story is throughout of secondary
importance, indeed she is only a spectator.</p>

<p>All this has the appearance of a genuine dream, and those of my
readers who have a wide experience of the dreams of girls of this
age will assuredly confirm this view. Hence the meaning of the dream
is so simple that we may quietly leave its interpretation to her
school-companions, whose declarations are as follows:</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Aural Witnesses.</span></p>

<p><em>Witness I.</em>&mdash;"M. dreamed that she and Lina P. had gone
swimming with our teacher. After they had swum out in the
lake pretty far, M. said she could not swim any further as her
foot hurt her so much. The teacher said she might sit on my<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
back. M. got up and they swam out. After a time a steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
came along and they got up on it. Our teacher seems to have had a rope
by which he tied M. and L. together and dragged them out into the lake.
They travelled thus as far as Z., where they stepped out. But now they
had no clothes on. The teacher bought a jacket whilst M. and L. got a
long, thick veil, and all three walked up the street along the lake.
This was when the wedding was going on. Presently they met the party.
The bride had on a blue silk dress but no veil. She asked M. and L. if
they would be kind enough to give her their veil. M. and L. gave it,
and in return they were allowed to go to the wedding. They went into
the Sun Inn. Afterwards they went a honeymoon journey to Andermatt; I
do not know now whether they went to the Inn at A. or at Z. There they
got coffee, potatoes, honey, and butter."</p>

<p>"I must not say any more, only the teacher finally was made
godfather."</p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;The roundabout story concerning the want
of room in the swimming-bath is absent; Marie goes direct with her
teacher to the bath. Their persons are more closely bound together in
the water by means of the rope fastening the teacher and the two girls
together. The ambiguity of the "getting up" in the first story has
other consequences here, for the part about the steamer in the first
story now occurs in two places; in the first the teacher takes Marie
on his back. The delightful little slip "she could sit on my back"
(instead of <em>his</em>), shows the real part taken by the narrator
herself in this scene. This makes it clear why the dream brings the
steamer somewhat abruptly into action, in order to give an innocent,
harmless turn to the equivocal "getting up" instead of another which is
common, for instance, in music-hall songs. The passage about the want
of clothing, the uncertainty of which has been already noticed, arouses
the special interest of the narrator. The teacher buys a jacket, the
girls get a long veil (such as one only wears in case of death or at
weddings). That the latter is meant is shown by the remark that the
bride had none (it is the bride who wears the veil). The narrator, a
girl-friend of Marie, here helps the dreamer to dream further: the
possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of the veil designates the bride or the brides, Marie and Lina.
Whatever is shocking or immoral in this situation is relieved by
the girls giving up the veil; it then takes an innocent turn. The
narrator follows the same mechanism in the cloaking of the equivocal
scene at Andermatt; there is nothing but nice food, coffee, potatoes,
honey, butter, a turning back to the infantile life according to the
well-known method. The conclusion is apparently very abrupt: the
teacher becomes a godfather.</p>

<p><em>Witness II.</em>&mdash;M. dreamt she had gone bathing with L. P. and
the teacher. Far out in the lake M. said to the teacher that her leg
was hurting her very much. Then the teacher said she could get up on
him. I don't know now whether the last sentence was really so told, but
I think so. As there was just then a ship on the lake the teacher said
she should swim as far as the ship and then get in. I don't remember
exactly how it went on. Then the teacher or M., I don't really remember
which, said they would get out at Z. and run home. Then the teacher
called out to two gentlemen who had just been bathing there, that they
might carry the children to land. Then L. P. sat up on one man, and M.
on the other fat man, and the teacher held on to the fat man's leg and
swam after them. Arrived on land they ran home. On the way the teacher
met his friend who had a wedding. M. said: "It was then the fashion to
go on foot, not in a carriage." Then the bride said she must now go
along also. Then the teacher said it would be nice if the two girls
gave the bride their black veils, which they had got on the way. I
can't now remember how. The children gave it her, and the bride said
they were really dear generous children. Then they went on further and
put up at the Sun Hotel. There they got something to eat, I don't know
exactly what. Then they went to a barn and danced. All the men had
taken off their coats except the teacher. Then the bride said he ought
to take off his coat also. Then the teacher hesitated but finally did
so. Then the teacher was.... Then the teacher said he was cold. I must
not tell any more; it is improper. That's all I heard of the dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;The narrator pays special attention to the
getting up, but is uncertain whether in the original it referred to
getting up on the teacher or the steamer. This uncertainty is, however,
amply compensated for by the elaborate invention of the two strangers
who take the girls upon their backs. The getting up is too valuable a
thought for the narrator to surrender, but she is troubled by the idea
of the teacher seeing the object. The want of clothing likewise arouses
much interest. The bride's veil has, it is true, become the black veil
of mourning (naturally in order to conceal anything indelicate). There
is not only no innocent twisting, but it is conspicuously virtuous
("dear, generous children"); the amoral wish has become changed into
virtue which receives special emphasis, arousing suspicion as does
every accentuated virtue.</p>

<p>This narrator exuberantly fills in the blanks in the scene of the
barn: the men take off their coats; the teacher also, and is therefore
... <i>i.e.</i> naked and hence cold. Whereupon it becomes too improper.</p>

<p>The narrator has correctly recognised the parallels which were
suspected in the criticisms of the original dream; she has filled
in the scene about the undressing which belongs to the bathing, for
it must finally come out that the girls are together with the naked
teacher.</p>

<p><em>Witness III.</em>&mdash;M. told me she had dreamt: Once I went
to the baths but there was no room for me. The teacher took me into his
dressing-room. I undressed and went bathing. I swam until I reached the
bank. Then I met the teacher. He said would I not like to swim across
the lake with him. I went, and L. P. also. We swam out and were soon in
the middle of the lake. I did not want to swim any further. Now I can't
remember it exactly. Soon a ship came up, and we got up on the ship.
The teacher said, "I am cold," and a sailor gave us an old shirt. The
three of us each tore a piece of the shirt away. I fastened it round
the neck. Then we left the ship and swam away towards K.</p>

<p>L. P. and I did not want to go further, and two fat men
took us upon their backs. In K. we got a veil which we put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
on. In K. we went into the street. The teacher met his friend who
invited us to the wedding. We went to the Sun and played games. We also
danced the polonaise; now I don't remember exactly. Then we went for
a honeymoon journey to Andermatt. The teacher had no money with him,
and stole some chestnuts in Andermatt. The teacher said, "I am so glad
that I can travel with my two pupils." Then there is something improper
which I will not write. The dream is now finished.</p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;The undressing together now takes place in the
narrow space of the dressing-room at the baths. The want of dress on
the ship gives occasion to a further variant. (The old shirt torn in
three.) In consequence of great uncertainty the getting up on the
teacher is not mentioned. Instead, the two girls get up on two fat men.
As "fat" becomes so prominent it should be noted that the teacher is
more than a little plump. The setting is thoroughly typical; each one
has a teacher. The duplication or multiplication of the persons is an
expression of their significance, <i>i.e.</i> of the stored-up libido.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
(Compare the duplication of the attribute in dementia præcox in
my "Psychology of Dementia Præcox.") In cults and mythologies the
significance of this duplication is very striking. (Cp. the Trinity and
the two mystical formulas of confession: "Isis una quæ es omnia. Hermes
omnia solus et ter unus.") Proverbially we say he eats, drinks, or
sleeps "for two." The multiplication of the personality expresses also
an analogy or comparison&mdash;<em>my friend</em> has the same "ætiological
value" (Freud) as <em>myself</em>. In dementia præcox, or schizophrenia,
to use Bleuler's wider and better term, the multiplication of the
personality is mainly the expression of the stored-up libido, for it
is invariably the person to whom the patient has transference who is
subjected to this multiplication. ("There are two professors N." "Oh,
you are also Dr. J.; this morning another came to see me who called
himself Dr. J.") It seems that, corresponding to the general tendency
in schizophrenia, this splitting is an analytic degradation whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
motive is to prevent the arousing of too violent impressions. A final
significance of the multiplication of personality which, however, does
not come exactly under this concept is the raising of some attribute
of the person to a living figure. A simple instance is Dionysos and
his companion Phales, wherein Phales is the equivalent of Phallos, the
personification of the penis of Dionysos. The so-called attendants of
Dionysos (Satyri, Sileni, Mænades, Mimallones, etc.) consist of the
personification of the attributes of Dionysos.</p>

<p>The scene in Andermatt is portrayed with a nice wit, or more
properly speaking, dreamt further: "The teacher steals chestnuts,"
that is equivalent to saying he does what is prohibited. By chestnuts
is meant roasted chestnuts, which on account of the incision are known
as a female sexual symbol. Thus the remark of the teacher, that he
was especially glad to travel with his pupils, following directly
upon the theft of the chestnuts, becomes intelligible. This theft of
the chestnuts is certainly a personal interpolation, for it does not
occur in any of the other accounts. It shows how intensive was the
inner participation of the school companions of Marie X. in the dream,
resting upon similar ætiological requirements.</p>

<p>This is the last of the aural witnesses. The story of the veil, the
pain in the feet, are items which we may perhaps suspect to have been
suggested in the original narrative. Other interpolations are, however,
absolutely personal, and are due to independent inner participation in
the meaning of the dream.</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Hearsay Evidence.</span></p>

<p>(I.) The whole school had to go bathing with the teacher. M. X. had
no place in the bath in which to undress. Then the teacher said: "You
can come into my room and undress with me." She must have felt very
uncomfortable. When both were undressed they went into the lake. The
teacher took a long rope and wound it round M. Then they both swam far
out. But M. got tired, and then the teacher took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
her upon his back. Then M. saw Lina P.; she called out to her, Come
along with me, and Lina came. Then they all swam out still farther.
They met a ship. Then the teacher asked, "May we get in? these girls
are tired." The boat stopped, and they could all get up. I do not
know exactly how they came ashore again at K. Then the teacher got
an old night-shirt. He put it on. Then he met an old friend who was
celebrating his wedding. The teacher, M. and L. were invited. The
wedding was celebrated at the Crown in K. They wanted to play the
polonaise. The teacher said he would not accompany them. Then the
others said he might as well. He did it with M. The teacher said: "I
shall not go home again to my wife and children. I love you best, M."
She was greatly pleased. After the wedding there was the honeymoon
journey. The teacher, M. and L. had to accompany the others also. The
journey was to Milan. Afterwards they went to Andermatt, where they
could find no place to sleep. They went to a barn, where they could
stop the night all together. I must not say any more because it becomes
highly improper.</p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;The undressing in the swimming-bath is properly
detailed. The union in the water receives a further simplification for
which the story of the rope led the way; the teacher fastens himself
to Marie. Lina P. is not mentioned at all; she only comes later when
Marie is already sitting upon the teacher. The dress is here a jacket.
The wedding ceremony contains a very direct meaning. "The teacher will
not go home any more to wife and child." Marie is the darling. In
the barn they all found a place together, and then it becomes highly
improper.</p>

<p>(II.) It was said that she had gone with the school to the
swimming-baths to bathe. But as the baths were over-full the teacher
had called her to come to him. We swam out to the lake, and L. P.
followed us. Then the teacher took a string and bound us to one
another. I do not know now exactly how they again got separated. But
after a long time they suddenly arrived at Z. There a scene is said to
have taken place which I would rather not tell, for if it were true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
it would be too disgraceful; also now I don't know exactly how it is
said to have been, for I was very tired, only I also heard that M. X.
is said to have told how she was always to remain with our teacher,
and he again and again caressed her as his favourite pupil. If I knew
exactly I would also say the other thing, but my sister only said
something about a little child which was born there, and of which the
teacher was said to have been the godfather.</p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;Note that in this story the improper scene
is inserted in the place of the wedding ceremony, where it is as
apposite as at the end, for the attentive reader will certainly have
already observed that the improper scene could have taken place in the
swimming-bath dressing-room. The procedure has been adopted which is
so frequent in dreams as a whole; the final thoughts of a long series
of dream images contain exactly what the first image of the series
was trying to represent. The censor pushes the complex away as long
as possible through ever-renewed disguises, displacements, innocent
renderings, etc. It does not take place in the bathing-room, in the
water the "getting up" does not occur, on landing it is not on the
teacher's back that the girls are sitting, it is another pair who are
married in the barn, another girl has the child, and the teacher is
only&mdash;godfather. All these images and situations are, however,
directed to pick out the complex, the desire for coitus. Nevertheless
the action still occurs at the back of all these metamorphoses, and the
result is the birth placed at the end of the scene.</p>

<p>(III.) Marie said: the teacher had a wedding with his wife, and
they went to the "Crown" and danced with one another. M. said a lot
of wild things which I cannot repeat or write about, for it is too
embarrassing.</p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;Here everything is too improper to be told. Note
that the marriage takes place with the wife.</p>

<p>(IV.) ... that the teacher and M. once went bathing, and he asked
M. whether she wanted to come along too. She said "yes." When they had
gone out together they met L. P., and the teacher asked whether she
wished to come along. And they went out farther. Then I also heard that
she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that the teacher said L. P. and she were the favourite pupils. She also
told us that the teacher was in his swimming drawers. Then they went to
a wedding, and the bride got a little child.</p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;The personal relationship to the teacher is
strongly emphasised (the "favourite pupils"), likewise the want of
clothing ("swimming drawers").</p>

<p>(V.) M. and L. P. went bathing with the teacher. When M. and L.
P. and the teacher had swum a little way, M. said: "I cannot go any
further, teacher, my foot hurts me." Then the teacher said she should
sit on his back, which M. did. Then a small steamer came along, and
the teacher got into the ship. The teacher had also two ropes, and
he fastened both children to the ship. Then they went together to Z.
and got out there. Then the teacher bought himself a dressing jacket
and put it on, and the children had put a cloth over themselves. The
teacher had a bride, and they were in a barn. Both children were with
the teacher and the bride in the barn, and danced. I must not write the
other thing, for it is too awful.</p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;Here Marie sits upon the teacher's back. The
teacher fastens the two children by ropes to the ship, from which
it can be seen how easily ship is put for teacher. The jacket again
emerges as the piece of clothing. It was the teacher's own wedding, and
what is improper comes after the dance.</p>

<p>(VI.) The teacher is said to have gone bathing with the whole
school. M. could not find any room, and she cried. The teacher is said
to have told M. she could come into his dressing-room.</p>

<p>"I must leave out something here and there," said my sister, "for
it is a long story." But she told me something more which I must tell
in order to speak the truth. When they were in the bath the teacher
asked M. if she wished to swim out into the lake with him. To which
she replied, "If I go along, you come also." Then we swam until about
half-way. Then M. got tired, and then the teacher pulled her by a cord.
At K. they went on land, and from there to Z.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
(The teacher was all the time dressed as in the bath.) There we met a
friend, whose wedding it was. We were invited by this friend. After the
ceremony there was a honeymoon journey, and we came to Milan. We had to
pass one night in a barn where something occurred which I cannot say.
The teacher said we were his favourite pupils, and he also kissed M.</p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;The excuse "I must leave out something here
and there" replaces the undressing. The teacher's want of clothing
is emphasised. The journey to Milan is a typical honeymoon. This
passage also seems to be an independent fancy, due to some personal
participation. Marie clearly figures as the loved one.</p>

<p>(VII.) The whole school and the teacher went bathing. They all went
into one room. The teacher also. M. alone had no place, and the teacher
said to her, "I have still room," she went. Then the teacher said, "Lie
on my back, I will swim out into the lake with you." I must not write
any more, for it is improper; I can hardly say it at all. Beyond the
improper part which followed I do not know any more of the dream.</p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;The narrator approaches the basis. Marie is to lie
upon the teacher's back in the bathing compartment. Beyond the improper
part she cannot give any more of the dream.</p>

<p>(VIII.) The whole school went bathing. M. had no room and was
invited by the teacher into his compartment. The teacher swam out with
her and told her that she was his darling or something like that. When
they got ashore at Z. a friend was just having a wedding and he invited
them both in their swimming costumes. The teacher found an old dressing
jacket and put it over the swimming drawers. He (the teacher) also
kissed M. and said he would not return home to his wife any more. They
were also both invited on the honeymoon journey. On the journey they
passed Andermatt, where they could not find any place to sleep, and
so had to sleep in the hay. There was a woman; the dreadful part now
comes, it is not at all right to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
something serious into mockery and laughter. This woman got a small
child. I will not say any more now, for it becomes too dreadful.</p>

<p><em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;The narrator is thoroughgoing. (He told her simply
she was his darling. He kissed her and said he would not go home to
his wife.) The vexation about the silly tattling which breaks through
at the end suggests some peculiarity in the narrator. From subsequent
investigation it was found that this girl was the only one of the
witnesses who had been early and intentionally given an explanation
about sex by her mother.</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Epicrisis.</span></p>

<p>So far as the interpretation of the dream is concerned, there
is nothing for me to add; the children have taken care of all the
essentials, leaving practically nothing over for psychoanalytic
interpretation. <em>Rumour has analysed and interpreted the dream.</em> So
far as I know rumour has not hitherto been investigated in this new
capacity. This case certainly makes it appear worth while to fathom
the psychology of rumour. In the presentation of the material I have
purposely restricted myself to the psychoanalytic point of view,
although I do not deny that my material offers numerous openings for
the invaluable researches of the followers of Stern, Claparède, and
others.</p>

<p>The material enables us to understand the structure of the rumour,
but psychoanalysis cannot rest satisfied with that. The why and
wherefore of the whole manifestation demands further knowledge. As we
have seen, the teacher, astonished by this rumour, was left puzzled
by the problem, wondering as to its cause and effect. How can a
dream which is notoriously incorrect and meaningless (for teachers
are, as is well known, grounded in psychology) produce such effects,
such malicious gossip? Faced by this, the teacher seems to have
instinctively hit upon the correct answer. The effect of the dream can
only be explained by its being "le vrai mot de la situation," <i>i.e.</i>
that the dream formed the fit expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
for something that was already in the air. It was the spark which
fell into the powder magazine. The material contains all the proofs
essential for this view. I have repeatedly drawn attention to their own
unrecognised participation in the dream by Marie's school-companions,
and the special points of interest where any of them have added their
own phantasies or dreams. The class consists of girls between twelve
and thirteen years of age, who therefore are in the midst of the
prodromata of puberty. The dreamer Marie X. is herself physically
almost completely developed sexually, and in this respect ahead of her
class; she is therefore a leader who has given the watchword for the
unconscious, and thus brought to expression the sexual complexes of her
companions which were lying there ready prepared.</p>

<p>As can be easily understood, the occasion was most painful to the
teacher. The supposition that therein lay some secret motive of the
schoolgirls is justified by the psychoanalytic axiom&mdash;judge
actions by their results rather than by their conscious motives.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
Consequently it would be probable that Marie X. had been especially
troublesome to her teacher. Marie at first liked this teacher most of
all. In the course of the latter half-year her position had, however,
changed. She had become dreamy and inattentive, and towards the dusk
of evening was afraid to go into the streets for fear of bad men.
She talked several times to her companions about sexual things in a
somewhat obscene way; her mother asked me anxiously how she should
explain the approaching menstruation to her daughter. On account of
this alteration in conduct Marie had forfeited the good opinion of
her teacher, as was clearly evidenced for the first time by a school
report, which she and some of her friends had received a few days
before the outbreak of the rumour. The disappointment was so great that
the girls had imagined all kinds of fancied acts of revenge against
the teacher; for instance, they might push him on to the lines so that
the train would run over him, etc. Marie was especially to the fore
in these murderous phantasies. On the night of this great outburst of
anger, when her former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
liking for her teacher seemed quite forgotten, that repressed part of
herself announced itself in the dream, and fulfilled its desire for
sexual union with the teacher&mdash;as a compensation for the hate
which had filled the day.</p>

<p>On waking, the dream became a subtle instrument of her hatred,
because the wish-idea was also that of her school companions, as it
always is in rumours of this kind. Revenge certainly had its triumph,
but the recoil upon Marie herself was still more severe. Such is the
rule when our impulses are given over to the unconscious. Marie X. was
expelled from school, but upon my report she was allowed to return to
it.</p>

<p>I am well aware that this little communication is inadequate
and unsatisfactory from the point of view of exact science. Had
the original story been accurately verified we should have clearly
demonstrated what we have now been only able to suggest. This case
therefore only posits a question, and it remains for happier observers
to collect convincing experiences in this field.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="p3">ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF NUMBER-DREAMS<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>


<p>The symbolism of numbers which greatly engaged the imaginative
philosophy of earlier centuries has again acquired a fresh interest
from the analytic investigations of Freud and his school. But in the
material of number-dreams we no longer discover conscious puzzles of
symbolic concatenations of numbers but the unconscious roots of the
symbolism of numbers. There is scarcely anything quite fundamentally
new to offer in this sphere since the presentations of Freud, Adler
and Stekel. It must here suffice to corroborate their experiences by
recording parallel cases. I have had under observation a few cases of
this kind which are worth reporting for their general interest.</p>

<p>The first three instances are from a middle-aged married man whose
conflict of the moment was an extra-conjugal love affair. The piece of
the dream from which I take the symbolised number is: <em>in front of
the manager his general subscription. The manager comments on the high
number of the subscription. It reads 2477.</em></p>

<p>The analysis of the dream brings out a rather ungentlemanly
reckoning up of the expense of the affair, which is foreign to the
generous nature of the dreamer, and which the unconscious makes use
of as a resistance to this affair. The preliminary interpretation is,
therefore, that the number has some financial importance and origin. A
rough estimate of the expenses so far leads to a number which in fact
approaches 2477 francs; a more exact reckoning, however, gives 2387
francs, which could be only arbitrarily translated into 2477. I then
left the numbers to the free association of the patient;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
it occurs to him that the figure in the dream should be divided as
24-77. Perhaps it is a telephone number; this supposition proves
incorrect. The next association is that it is the total of some
numbers. A reminiscence then occurs to him that he once told me that he
had celebrated the 100th birthday of his mother and himself when his
mother was 65 and he was 35 years old. (Their birthdays are on the same
day.)</p>

<p>In this way the patient arrived at the following series of
associations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="associations">
<tr><td class="tdl">He is born on</td><td class="tdl">26 II.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">His mistress</td><td class="tdl">28 VIII.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">His wife</td><td class="tdl">1 III.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">His mother (his father is long dead)</td><td class="tdl">26 II.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">His two children</td><td class="tdl">29 IV.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"><span style="margin-left: 15em;">and&nbsp;</span></td><td class="tdl">13 VII.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">The patient is born</td><td class="tdl">II. 75.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">His mistress</td><td class="tdl">VIII. 85.</td></tr>

<p>This series, which includes all the members of his family,
gives the number 2477.</p>

<p>This construction led to a deeper layer of the dream's
meaning. The patient is most closely united to his family,
but on the other hand very much in love. This situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
provokes a severe conflict. The detailed description of the manager's
appearance (which I leave out for the sake of brevity) pointed to the
analyst, from whom the patient rightly fears and desires firm control
and criticism of his condition of dependence and bondage.</p>

<p>The dream which followed soon afterwards, reported in brief,
runs: <em>The analyst asks the patient what he actually does at his
mistress'? to which the patient replied he plays there, and that indeed
on a very high number, on 152. The analyst remarks: "You are sadly
cheated."</em></p>

<p>The analysis displayed again a repressed tendency to reckon up
the expense of the affair. The amount spent monthly was close on 152
francs, it was from 148-158 francs. The remark that he was being
cheated alludes to the point at issue in the difficulties of the
patient with his mistress. She maintains that he had deflowered
her; he, on the contrary, is firmly convinced that she was not a
virgin, and that she had already been seduced by some one else at the
time when he was seeking her favours and she was refusing him. The
expression "number" leads to the associations: number of the gloves,
calibre-number. From there the next step was to the fact that he
recognized, at the first coitus, a noticeable width of the opening
instead of the expected resistance of the hymen. To him, this is
proof of the deception. The unconscious naturally makes use of this
opportunity as an effective means of opposition to the relationship.
152 proves at first refractory to further analysis. The number on
a subsequent occasion aroused the really not remote association,
"house-number." Then came this series of associations. When the patient
first knew her the lady lived at X Street No. 17, then Y Street No.
129, then Z Street No. 48.</p>

<p>Here the patient thought that he had clearly gone far beyond 152,
the total being 194. It then occurred to him that the lady had removed
from No. 48 Z Street at his instigation for certain reasons; it
must therefore run 194 - 48 = 146. She now lives in A Street No. 6,
therefore 146 + 6 = 152.</p>

<p>The following dream was obtained during a later part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of the analysis. The patient dreamt that <em>he had received an account
from the analyst in which he was charged interest for delay in payment
from the period September 3rd to 29th. The interest on the total of 315
francs was 1 franc.</em></p>

<p>Under this reproach of meanness and avariciousness levelled at the
analyst, the patient covered, as analysis proved, a violent unconscious
envy. Diverse things in the life of the analyst can arouse the
patient's envy; one fact here in particular had recently made a marked
impression. His physician had received an addition to the family. The
disturbed relations between the patient and his wife unfortunately does
not permit such an expectation in his case. Hence his ground for envy
and invidious comparisons.</p>

<p>As before, the analysis of 315 produces a separation into
3&mdash;1&mdash;5. To three he associates&mdash;his doctor has three
children, just lately there is one in addition. He himself would have
five children were all living; as it is he has 3 - 1 = 2 living; for
three of the children were stillborn. The symbolism of the numbers is
not exhausted by these associations.</p>

<p>The patient remarks that the period from 3rd to 29th September
contains twenty-six days. His next thought is to add this and the other
figures of the dream:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">26</span></li>
<li>315</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">1</span></li>
<li>___</li>
<li>342</li>
<li>___</li>
</ul>

<p>With 342 he carries out the same operation as on 315,
splitting it into 3&mdash;4&mdash;2. Whereas before it came out that
his doctor had three children, and then had another, and
the patient had five, now it runs: the doctor had three
children, and now has four, patient has only two. He remarks
on this that the second figure sounds like a rectification
in contrast with the wish-fulfilment of the first.</p>

<p>The patient, who had discovered this explanation for
himself without my help, declared himself satisfied. His
physician, however, was not; to him it seemed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
above disclosures did not exhaust the rich possibilities that
determined the unconscious images. The patient had, for
instance, added to the figure five that of the stillborn children;
one was born in the 9th month and two in the 7th. He
also emphasised the fact that his wife had had two miscarriages,
one in the 5th week and the other in the 7th.
Adding these figures together we get the determination of
the number 26.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>It seems as if the number twenty-six were determined by
the number of the lost times of pregnancy. This time
(twenty-six days) denotes, in the dream, a delay for which
the patient was charged one franc interest. He has, in fact,
suffered a delay through the lost pregnancies, for his doctor
has, during the time the patient has known him, surpassed
him with one child. One franc must be one child. We have
already seen the tendency of the patient to add together all
his children, even the dead ones, in order to outdo his rival.
The thought that his physician had outdone him by one child
could easily react immediately upon the determination of 1.
We will therefore follow up this tendency of the patient and
carry on his play with figures, by adding to the figure 26
the two complete pregnancies of nine months each.</p>

<p class="center">26 + 9 + 9 = 44</p>

<p>If we follow the tendency to split up the numbers we get
2 + 6 and 4 + 4, two groups of figures which have only this
in common, that each group gives 8 by addition. These
numbers are, as we must notice, composed entirely of the
months of pregnancy given by the patient. Compare with
them those groups of figures which contain the information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
as to the doctor's fecundity, viz. 315 and 342; it is to be
noted that the resemblance lies in their sum-total giving
9 : 9 - 8 = 1. It looks as if here likewise the notion about
the differentiation of 1 were carried out. As the patient
remarked, 315 seems thus a wish-fulfilment, 342 on the other
hand a rectification. An ingenious fancy playing round will
discover the following difference between the two numbers:</p>

<p class="center">3 × 1 × 5 = 15. &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 × 4 × 2 = 24. &nbsp; &nbsp; 24 - 15 = 9</p>

<p>Here again we come upon the important figure 9, which
neatly combines the reckoning of the pregnancies and births.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say where the borderline of play begins;
necessarily so, for the unconscious product is the creation of a
sportive fancy, of that psychic impulse out of which play itself
arises. It is repugnant to the scientific mind to have serious dealings
with this element of play, which on all sides loses itself in the
vague. But it must be never forgotten that the human mind has for
thousands of years amused itself with just this kind of game; it were
therefore nothing wonderful if this historic past again compelled
admission in dream to similar tendencies. The patient pursues in his
waking life similar phantastic tendencies about figures, as is seen in
the fact already mentioned of the celebration of the 100th birthday.
Their presence in the dream therefore need not surprise us. In a single
example of unconscious determination exact proofs are often lacking,
but the sum of our experiences entitles us to rely upon the accuracy
of the individual discoveries. In the investigation of free creative
phantasy we are in the region, almost more than anywhere else, of
broad empiricism; a high measure of discretion as to the accuracy of
individual results is consequently required, but this in nowise obliges
us to pass over in silence what is active and living, for fear of
being execrated as unscientific. There must be no parleying with the
superstition-phobia of the modern mind; for this itself is a means by
which the secrets of the unconscious are kept veiled.</p>

<p>It is of special interest to see how the problems of the
patient are mirrored in the unconscious of his wife. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
wife had the following dream: She dreamt, and this is the whole dream:
"<em>Luke</em> 137." The analysis of the number gives the following. To 1
she associates: The doctor has another child. He had three. If all
her children were living she would have 7; now she has only 3 - 1 =
2. But she desires 1 + 3 + 7 = 11 (a twin number, 1 and 1), which
expresses her wish that her two children had been pairs of twins, for
then she would have reached the same number of children as the doctor.
Her mother once had twins. The hope of getting a child by her husband
is very precarious; this had for a long time turned her ideas in the
unconscious towards a second marriage. Other phantasies pictured her
as "done with," <i>i.e.</i> having reached the climacteric at 44. She is
now 33 years old, therefore in 11 years she will have reached her 44th
year. This is an important period as her father died in his 44th year.
Her phantasy of the 44th year contains the idea of the death of her
father. The emphasis on the death of her father corresponds to the
repressed phantasy of the death of her husband, who is the obstacle to
a second marriage. At this place the material belonging to the dream
"<em>Luke</em> 137" comes in to solve the conflict. The dreamer is, one soon
discovers, in no wise well up in her Bible, she has not read it for an
incredible time, she is not at all religious. It would be therefore
quite purposeless to have recourse to associations here. The dreamer's
ignorance of her Bible is so great that she did not even know that the
citation "<em>Luke</em> 137" could only refer to the Gospel of St. Luke. When
she turned up the New Testament she came to the Acts of the Apostles.
As chapter i. has only 26 verses and not 37, she took the 7th verse,
"It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father
hath put in his own power."</p>

<p>But if we turn to Luke i. 37, we find the Annunciation of the
Virgin.</p>

<p>Verse 35. The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the
Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which
shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Verse 36. And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived
a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was
called barren.</p>

<p>Verse 37. For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p>

<p>The necessary continuation of the analysis of "<cite>Luke</cite> 137" demanded
the looking up of Luke xiii. 7, where it says:</p>

<p>Verse 6. A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and
he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.</p>

<p>Verse 7. Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold,
these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none:
cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</p>

<p>The fig-tree, which from antiquity has been a symbol of the male
genital, is to be cut down on account of its unfruitfulness. This
passage is in complete accord with innumerable sadistic phantasies of
the dreamer, concerned with the cutting or biting off of the penis.
The relation to her husband's unfruitful organ is obvious. That she
withdraws her libido from her husband is clear for he is impotent as
regard herself; it is equally clear that she undergoes regression
to the father ("which the father hath put in his own power") and
identifies herself with her mother who had twins.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
By thus advancing her age the dreamer places her husband in regard to
herself in the position of a son or boy, of an age at which impotency
is normal. Furthermore, the desire to overcome her husband is easily
understood from, and amply evidenced in her earlier analysis. It is
therefore only a confirmation of what has been already said, if,
following up the matter of "<em>Luke</em> 137," we find in Luke vii. verse 12,
Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead
man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. (13)
And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her,
Weep not. (14) And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him
stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p>

<p>In the particular psychological situation of the dreamer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the allusion to the resurrection presents a delightful meaning
as the cure of her husband's impotency. Then the whole
problem would be solved. There is no need for me to point
out in so many words the numerous wish-fulfilments contained
in this material; they are obvious to the reader.</p>

<p>The important combination of the symbol "<em>Luke</em> 137"
must be conceived as cryptomnesia, since the dreamer is quite
unversed in the Bible. Both Flournoy<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and myself<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> have
already drawn attention to the important effects of this phenomenon. So
far as one can be humanly certain, the question of any manipulation of
the material with intent to deceive does not come into consideration in
this case. Those well posted in psychoanalysis will be able to allay
any such suspicion simply from the disposition and setting of the
material as a whole.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="p3">A CRITICISM OF BLEULER'S "THEORY OF
SCHIZOPHRENIC NEGATIVISM"<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>


<p>Bleuler's work contains a noteworthy clinical analysis of
"Negativism." Besides giving a very precise and discerning
summary of the various manifestations of negativism, the
author presents us with a new psychological conception well
worthy of attention, viz. the concept of <em>ambivalency</em> and of
<em>ambitendency</em>, thus formulating the psychological axiom that
every tendency is balanced by its opposite tendency (to this
must be added that positive action is produced by <em>a comparatively
small leaning to one side of the scale</em>). Similarly all
other tendencies, under the stress of emotions, are balanced
by their opposites&mdash;thus giving an <em>ambivalent</em> character to
their expression. This theory rests on clinical observation of
katatonic negativism, which more than proves the existence
of contrasting tendencies and values. These facts are well
known to psychoanalysis, where they are summed up under
the concept of resistance. But this must not be taken as
meaning that every positive psychic action simply calls up its
opposite. One may easily gain the impression from Bleuler's
work that his standpoint is that, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cum grano salis</i>, the conception
or the tendency of the Schizophrenic is always accompanied
by its opposite. For instance, Bleuler says:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. "Disposing causes of negativistic phenomena are: the
<em>ambitendency</em> by which every impulse is accompanied by its
opposite."</p>

<p>2. "<em>Ambivalency</em>, which gives two opposed emotional expressions to
the same idea, and would regard that idea as positive and negative at
the same time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>3. "<em>The schizophrenic splitting</em> of the psyche prevents any
final summing up of the conflicting and corresponding psychisms, so
that the unsuitable impulse can be realised just as much as the right
one, and the negative thought substituted for the right one." "On this
theory, negative manifestations may directly arise, since non-selected
positive and negative psychisms may stand for one another," and so
on.</p>

<p>If we investigate psychoanalytically a case of obvious ambivalency,
<i>i.e.</i> of a more or less unexpected negative reaction instead of a
positive one, we find that there is a strict sequence of psychological
causes conditioning negative reaction. The tendency of this sequence is
to disturb the intention of the contrasting or opposite series, that
is to say, <em>it is resistance set up by a complex</em>. This fact,
which has not yet been refuted by any other observations, seems to me
to contradict the above-mentioned formulæ. (For confirmation, see my
"Psychology of Dementia Præcox," p. 103.) Psychoanalysis has proved
conclusively that a resistance always has an intention and a meaning;
that there is no such thing as a capricious playing with contrasts.
The systematic character of resistance holds good, as I believe I
have proved, even in schizophrenia. So long as this position, founded
upon a great variety of experience, is not disproved by any other
observations, the theory of negativism must adapt itself to it. Bleuler
in a sense supports this when he says: "For the most part the negative
reaction does not simply appear as accidental, <em>but is actually
preferred to the right one</em>." This is an admission that negativism
is of the nature of resistance. Once admit this, and the primary
importance of ambivalency disappears so far as negativism is concerned.
The tendency to resistance remains as the only fundamental principle.
Ambivalency can in no sense be put on all fours with the "schizophrenic
splitting of the psyche," but must be regarded as a concept which gives
expression to the universal and ever-present inner association of pairs
of opposites. (One of the most remarkable examples of this is the
"contrary meaning of root-words." See Freud's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
"Essay on Dreams," Jahrbuch, vol. II., p. 179.) The same thing
applies to ambitendency. Neither is specific of schizophrenia, but
applies equally to the neuroses and the normal. All that is specific
to katatonic negativism is <em>the intentional contrast, i.e. the
resistance</em>. From this explanation we see that resistance is something
different from ambivalency; it is the dynamic factor which makes
manifest the everywhere latent ambivalency. What is characteristic
of the diseased mind is not ambivalency but resistance. This implies
the existence of a conflict between two opposite tendencies which has
succeeded in raising the normally present ambivalency into a struggle
of opposing components. (Freud has very aptly called this, "The
separation of pairs of opposites.") In other words it is a conflict
of wills, bringing about the neurotic condition of "disharmony within
the self." This condition is the only "splitting of the psyche" known
to us, and is not so much to be regarded as a predisposing cause, but
rather as a manifestation resulting from the inner conflict&mdash;the
"incompatibility of the complex" (Riklin).</p>

<p><em>Resistance</em>, as the fundamental fact of schizophrenic dissociation,
thus becomes something which, in contra-distinction to ambivalency, is
not <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">eo ipso</i> identical with the concept of the state of feeling, but
is a secondary and supplementary one, with its own special and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quasi</i>
independent psychological development; and this is identical with the
necessary previous history of the complex in every case. It follows
that the theory of negativism coincides with the theory of the complex,
as the complex is the cause of the resistance.</p>

<p>Bleuler summarises the causes of negativism as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>a</i>) The autistic retirement of the patient into his own
phantasies.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The existence of a life-wound (complex) which must
be protected from injury.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The misconception of the environment and of its
meaning.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The directly hostile relation to environment.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The pathological irritability of schizophrenics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) The "press of ideas," and other aggravations of
action and thought.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Sexuality with its ambivalency on the emotional plane
is often one of the roots of negative reaction.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(<i>a</i>) Autistic withdrawal into one's own phantasies<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> is
what I formerly designated as the obvious overgrowth of the
phantasies of the complex. The strengthening of the complex
is coincident with the increase of the resistance.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The life-wound (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Lebenswund</i>) is the complex which, as
a matter of course, is present in every case of schizophrenia,
and of necessity always carries with it the phenomena of
autism or auto-erotism (introversion), for complexes and involuntary
egocentricity are inseparable reciprocities. Points
(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are therefore identical. (<cite>Cf.</cite> "Psychology of
Dementia Præcox," chapters ii. and iii.)</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) It is proved that the misconception of environment
is an assimilation of the complex.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The hostile relation to environment is the maximum
of resistance as psychoanalysis clearly shows. (<i>d</i>) goes
with (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) "Irritability" proves itself psychoanalytically to be
one of the commonest results of the complex. I designated
it <em>complex-sensibility</em>. Its generalised form (if one may use
such an expression) manifests itself as a damming up of the
affect (= damming of the <em>libido</em>), consequent on increased
resistance. So-called neurasthenia is a classical example
of this.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Under the term "press of ideas," and similar intellectual
troubles, may be classified the "want of clearness and logic of the
schizophrenic thinking," which Bleuler considers a predisposing
cause. I have, as I may presume is known, expressed myself with much
reserve on what he regards as the premeditation of the schizophrenic
adjustment. Further and wider experience has taught me that the laws of
the Freudian psychology of dreams and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
theory of the neuroses must be turned towards the obscurities
of schizophrenic thinking. <em>The painfulness of the
elaborated complex necessitates a censorship of its expression.</em><a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
This principle has to be applied to schizophrenic disturbance in
thinking; and until it has been proved that this principle is not
applicable to schizophrenia, there is no justification for setting up
a new principle; <i>i.e.</i> to postulate that schizophrenic disturbance
of ideas is something primary. Investigations of hypnagogic activity,
as well as association reactions in states of concentrated attention,
give psychical results which up to now are indistinguishable from the
mental conditions in schizophrenia. For example excessive relaxation
of attention suffices to conjure up images as like as two peas to the
phantasies and expressions of schizophrenia. It will be remembered
that I have attributed the notorious disturbances of attention in
schizophrenia to the special character of the complex; an idea which my
experience since 1906 have further confirmed. There are good reasons
for believing specific schizophrenic thought-disturbance to be the
<em>result of a complex</em>.</p>

<p>Now as regards the symptoms of thought-pressure, it is first and
foremost a thought-compulsion, which, as Freud has shown, is first a
thought-complex and secondly a <em>sexualisation of the thought</em>. Then
to the symptom of thought-pressure there is superadded at least a
<em>demoniac</em> impulse such as <em>may be observed in every vigorous release
or production of libido</em>.</p>

<p>Thought-pressure, on closer examination, is seen to be a result of
schizophrenic introversion, which necessarily leads to a sexualisation
of the thought; <i>i.e.</i> to an autonomy of the complex.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) <em>The transition to sexuality</em> appears from the psychoanalytical
standpoint difficult to understand. If we consider that the development
of resistance coincides in every case with the history of the complex
we must ask ourselves: Is the complex sexual or not? (It goes without
saying that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>we must understand sexuality in its proper sense of psycho-sexuality.)
To this question psychoanalysis gives the invariable answer:
<em>Resistance always springs from a peculiar sexual development</em>.
The latter leads in the well-known manner to conflict, <i>i.e.</i> to
the complex. Every case of schizophrenia which has so far been
analysed confirms this. It can therefore claim at least to be a
working hypothesis, and one to be followed up. In the present state
of our knowledge, it is therefore not easy to see why Bleuler only
allows to sexuality a <em>quasi</em>-determining influence on the phenomena
of negativism; for psychoanalysis demonstrates that the cause of
negativism is resistance; and that with schizophrenia, as with all
other neuroses, this arises from the peculiar sexual development.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be doubted to-day that schizophrenia, with its
preponderance of the mechanisms of introversion, possesses the same
mechanism as any other "psycho-neurosis." In my opinion, at any
rate, its peculiar symptoms (apart from the clinical and anatomical
standpoints) are only to be studied by psychoanalysis, <i>i.e.</i> when
the investigation is mainly directed to the genetic impetus. I have,
therefore, endeavoured to indicate how Bleuler's hypothesis stands in
the light of the theory of complexes; I feel myself bound to emphasise
the complex-theory in this relation, and am not disposed to surrender
this conception, which is as illuminating as it was difficult to
evolve.</p>

<p class="p3">PSYCHOANALYSIS<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>


<p>Psychoanalysis is not only scientific, but also technical in
character; and from results technical in their nature, has been
developed a new psychological science which might be called "analytical
psychology."</p>

<p>Psychologists and doctors in general are by no means conversant
with this particular branch of psychology, owing to the fact that
its technical foundations are as yet comparatively unknown to them.
Reason for this may be found in that the new method is exquisitely
psychological, and therefore belongs neither to the realm of medicine
nor to that of experimental psychology. The medical man has, as a rule,
but little knowledge of psychology; and the psychologist has no medical
knowledge. There is therefore a lack of suitable soil in which to plant
the spirit of this new method. Furthermore, the method itself appears
to many persons so arbitrary that they cannot reconcile it with their
scientific conscience. The conceptions of Freud, the founder of this
method, laid particular stress upon the sexual factor; this fact has
aroused strong prejudice, and many scientific men are repelled merely
by this feeling. I need hardly remark that such an antipathy is not a
logical ground for rejecting a new method. The facts being so, it is
obvious that the psychoanalyst should discuss the principles rather
than the results of his method, when he speaks in public; for he who
does not acknowledge the scientific character of the method cannot
acknowledge the scientific character of its results.</p>

<p>Before I enter into the principles of the psychoanalytic method, I
must mention two common prejudices against it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of these is that psychoanalysis is nothing but a somewhat
deep and complicated form of anamnesis. Now it is well known that the
anamnesis is based upon the evidence supplied by the patient's family,
and upon his own conscious self-knowledge, revealed in reply to direct
questions. The psychoanalyst naturally develops his anamnesic data as
carefully as any other specialist; but this is merely the patient's
history, and must not be confused with analysis. Analysis is the
reduction of an actual conscious content of a so-called accidental
nature, into its psychological determinants. This process has nothing
to do with the anamnesic reconstruction of the history of the
illness.</p>

<p>The second prejudice, which is based, as a rule, upon a superficial
knowledge of psychoanalytic literature, is that psychoanalysis is
a method of suggestion, by which a faith or doctrine of living is
imposed upon the patient, thereby effecting a cure in the manner of
mental healing or Christian Science. Many analysts, especially those
who have worked in psychoanalysis for a long time, previously used
therapeutic suggestion, and are therefore familiar with its workings.
They know that the psychoanalyst's method of working is diametrically
opposed to that of the hypnotist. In direct contrast with therapeutic
suggestion, the psychoanalyst does not attempt to force anything upon
his patient which the latter does not see himself, and find reasonable
with his own understanding. Faced with the constant desire on the
part of the neurotic patient to receive suggestions and advice, the
analyst just as constantly endeavours to lead him away from this
passive receptive attitude, and make him use his common sense and
powers of criticism, that equipped with these he may become fitted to
meet the problems of life independently. We have often been accused
of forcing interpretations upon patients, interpretations that were
frequently quite arbitrary in character. I wish that one of these
critics would make the attempt to force such arbitrary interpretations
upon my patients, who are often persons of great intelligence and high
culture, and who are, indeed, not infrequently my own colleagues. The
impossibility of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
an undertaking would soon be laid bare. In psychoanalysis we are
dependent upon the patient and his judgment, for the reason that the
very nature of analysis consists in leading him to a knowledge of his
own self. The principles of psychoanalysis are so entirely different
from those of therapeutic suggestion that they are not comparable.</p>

<p>An attempt has also been made to compare analysis with the reasoning
method of Dubois, which is in itself a rational process. This
comparison does not however hold good, for the psychoanalyst strictly
avoids argument and persuasion with his patients. He must naturally
listen to and take note of the conscious problems and conflicts of his
patient, but not for the purpose of fulfilling his desire to obtain
advice or direction with regard to his conduct. The problems of a
neurotic patient cannot be solved by advice and conscious argument.
I do not doubt that good advice at the right time can produce good
results; but I do not know whence one can obtain the belief that the
psychoanalyst can always give the right advice at the right time. The
neurotic conflict is frequently, indeed as a rule, of such a character
that advice cannot possibly be given. Furthermore, it is well known
that the patient only desires authoritative advice in order that he may
cast aside the burden of responsibility, referring himself and others
to the opinion of the higher authority.</p>

<p>In direct contrast to all previous methods, psychoanalysis
endeavours to overcome the disorders of the neurotic psyche through
the subconscious, not through the conscious self. In this work we
naturally have need of the patient's conscious content, for his
subconsciousness can only be reached <em>viâ</em> the conscious. The material
furnished by the anamnesis is the source from which our work starts.
The detailed recital usually furnishes many valuable clues which make
the psychogenic origin of the symptoms clear to the patient. This work
is naturally only necessary where the patient is convinced that his
neurosis is organic in its origin. But even in those cases where the
patient is convinced from the very first of the psychic nature of his
illness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a critical survey of the history is very advantageous, since it
discloses to him a psychological concatenation of ideas of which
he was unaware. In this manner those problems which need special
discussion are frequently brought to the surface. Work of this kind
may occupy many sittings. Finally the explanation of the conscious
material reaches an end, in so far as neither the patient nor the
doctor can add anything to it that is decisive in character. Under
the most favourable circumstances the end comes with the formulation
of the problem which proved itself to be impossible of solution. Let
us take, for instance, the case of a man who was once well, but who
became a neurotic between the age of 35 and 40. His position in life
is assured, and he has a wife and children. Parallel with his neurosis
he developed an intense resistance towards his professional work. He
observed that the first symptoms of neurosis became noticeable when
he had to overcome a certain difficulty in regard to it. Later on his
symptoms became aggravated with each successive difficulty that arose.
An amelioration in his neurosis occurred whenever fortune favoured him
in his professional work. The problem that results from a critical
discussion of the anamnesis is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The patient is aware that if he could improve his work, the mere
satisfaction that would result could bring about the much-desired
improvement in his neurotic condition. He cannot, however, make his
work more efficient because of his great resistance against it. This
problem cannot be solved by any reasoning process.</p>

<p>Let us take another case. A woman of 40, the mother of four
children, became neurotic four years ago after the death of one of her
children. A new period of pregnancy, followed by the birth of another
child, produced a great improvement in her condition. The patient now
lived in the thought that it would be a great help to her if she could
have yet another child. Believing, however, that this could not happen,
she attempted to devote her energies to philanthropic interests.
But she failed to obtain the least satisfaction from this work. She
observed a distinct alleviation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of her complaint whenever she succeeded in giving real, living interest
to any matter, but she felt entirely incapable of discovering anything
that could bring her lasting interest and satisfaction. It is clear
that no process of reasoning can solve this problem.</p>

<p>Here psychoanalysis must begin with the endeavour to solve the
problem as to what prevents the patient from developing interests above
and beyond her longing for a child.</p>

<p>Since we cannot assume that we know from the very beginning what the
solution of such problems is, we must at this point trust to the clues
furnished us by the individuality of the patient. Neither conscious
questioning nor rational advice can aid us in the discovery of these
clues, for the causes which prevent us from finding them are hidden
from her consciousness. There is, therefore, no clearly indicated
path by which to reach these subconscious inhibitions. The only rule
that psychoanalysis lays down for our guidance in this respect, is
to let the patient speak of that which occurs to him at the moment.
The analyst must observe carefully what the patient says and, in the
first instance, take due note thereof without attempting to force his
own opinions upon him. Thus we observe that the patient whom I first
mentioned begins by talking about his marriage, which we hitherto
had reason to regard as normal. We now learn that he constantly has
difficulties with his wife, and that he does not understand her in the
least. This knowledge causes the physician to remark that the patient's
professional work is clearly not his only problem; but that his
conjugal relations are also in need of revision. This starts a train of
thought in which many further ideas occur to the patient, concerning
his married life. Hereupon follow ideas about the love affairs he had
before his marriage. These experiences, related in detail, show that
the patient was always somewhat peculiar in his more intimate relations
with women, and that this peculiarity took the form of a certain
childish egoism. This is a new and surprising point of view for him,
and explains to him many of his misfortunes with women.</p>

<p>We cannot in every case get so far as this on the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
principle of letting the patient talk; few patients have their psychic
material so much on the surface. Furthermore, many persons have a
positive resistance against speaking freely about what occurs to
them on the spur of the moment; it is often too painful to tell the
doctor whom perhaps they do not entirely trust; in other cases because
apparently nothing occurs to them, they force themselves to speak of
matters about which they are more or less indifferent. This habit of
not talking to the point by no means proves that patients consciously
conceal their unpleasant contents, for such irrelevant speaking can
occur quite unconsciously. In such cases it sometimes helps the patient
if he is told that he must not force himself, that he must only seize
upon the very first thoughts that present themselves, no matter how
unimportant or ridiculous they may seem. In certain cases even these
instructions are of no use, and then the doctor is obliged to have
recourse to other expedients. One of these is the employment of the
association test, which usually gives excellent information as to the
chief momentary tendencies of the individual.</p>

<p>A second expedient is dream analysis; this is <em>the real instrument</em>
of psychoanalysis. We have already experienced so much opposition to
dream analysis that a brief exposition of its principles is necessary.
The interpretation of dreams, as well as the meaning given to them, is,
as we know, in bad odour. It is not long since that oneirocritics were
practised and believed in; nor is the time long past when even the most
enlightened human beings were entirely under the ban of superstition.
It is therefore comprehensible that our age should still retain a
certain lively fear of those superstitions which have but recently been
partially overcome. To this timidity in regard to superstition, the
opposition to dream analysis is in a large measure due; but analysis
is in no wise to blame for this. We do not select the dream as our
object because we pay it the homage of superstitious admiration, but
because it is a psychic product that is independent of the patient's
consciousness. We ask for the patient's free thoughts, but he gives us
little, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
nothing; or at best something forced or irrelevant. Dreams are free
thoughts, free phantasies, they are not forced, and they are psychic
phenomena just as much as thoughts are.</p>

<p>It may be said of the dream that it enters into the consciousness
as a complex structure, the connection between the elements of which
is not conscious. Only by afterwards joining associations to the
separate pictures of the dream, can the origin of these pictures, in
certain recollections of the near and more remote past, be proved.
One asks oneself: "Where have I seen or heard that?" And by the same
process of free association comes the memory that one has actually
experienced certain parts of the dream, some of them yesterday, some
at an earlier date. This is well known, and every one will probably
agree to it. Thus far the dream presents itself, as a rule, as an
incomprehensible composition of certain elements which are not in the
first instance conscious, but which are later recognised by the process
of free association. This might be disputed on the ground that it is
an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> statement. I must remark, however, that this conception
conforms to the only generally recognised working hypothesis as to the
genesis of dreams, namely, the derivation of the dream from experiences
and thoughts of the recent past. We are, therefore, upon known ground.
Not that certain dream parts have under all circumstances been known
to the individual, so that one might ascribe to them the character of
being conscious; on the contrary, they are frequently, even generally,
unrecognisable. Not until later do we remember having consciously
experienced this or that dream part. We may therefore regard the dream
from this point of view as a product that comes from a subconscious
origin. The technical unfolding of these subconscious sources is a mode
of procedure that has always been instinctively employed. One simply
tries to remember whence the dream parts come. Upon this most simple
principle the psychoanalytic method of solving dreams is based. It
is a fact that certain dream parts are derived from our waking life
and, indeed, from experiences which, owing to their notorious lack of
importance, would frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
have been consigned to certain oblivion, and were therefore well on
their way towards becoming definitely subconscious. Such dream parts
are the results of subconscious representations (images).</p>

<p>The principles according to which psychoanalysis solves dreams
are therefore exceedingly simple, and have really been known for a
long time. The further procedure follows the same path logically and
consistently. If one spends considerable time over a dream, which
really never happens outside psychoanalysis, one can succeed in finding
more and more recollections for the separate dream parts. It is,
however, not always possible to discover recollections for certain
other parts; and then one must leave them for the time being, whether
one likes it or not. When I speak of "recollections" I naturally do
not mean merely memories of certain concrete experiences, but also of
their inter-related meanings. The collected recollections are known
as the dream material. With this material one proceeds according
to a scientific method that is universally valid. If one has any
experimental material to work up, one compares its separate parts and
arranges them according to their similarities. Exactly the same course
is pursued in dealing with the dream material; one gathers together its
common characteristics, whether these be formal or material. In doing
this one must absolutely get rid of certain prejudices. I have always
observed that the beginner expects to find some tendency or other
according to which he endeavours to mould his material. I have noticed
this particularly in the cases of colleagues who were previously more
or less violent opponents of psychoanalysis, owing to their well-known
prejudices and misunderstandings. When fate willed that I should
analyse them, and they consequently gained at last an insight into the
method of analysis, it was demonstrated that the first mistake which
they had been apt to make in their own psychoanalytic practice was
that they forced the material into accord with their own preconceived
opinions; that is, they allowed their former attitude towards
psychoanalysis, which they were not able to appreciate objectively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
but only according to subjective phantasies, to have its influence
upon their material. If one goes so far as to venture upon the task of
examining the dream material, one must permit no comparison to frighten
one away. The material consists, as a general rule, of very unequal
images, from which it is under some circumstances most difficult to
obtain the "tertium comparationis." I must forego giving you detailed
examples of this, since it is quite impossible to introduce such
extensive material into a lecture.</p>

<p>One pursues, then, the same method in classifying the unconscious
content, as is used everywhere in comparing materials for the purpose
of drawing conclusions from them. One objection has often been made,
namely: why should the dream have a subconscious content at all? This
objection is unscientific in my opinion. Every psychological moment
has its own history. Every sentence that I utter has, besides the
meaning consciously intended by me, a meaning that is historical; and
this last may be entirely different from the conscious meaning. I am
purposely expressing myself somewhat paradoxically. I certainly should
not take it upon myself to explain each sentence according to its
individual-historical meaning. That is easier in the case of larger and
more complex formations. Every one is certainly convinced of the fact
that a poem&mdash;in addition to its manifest contents&mdash;is also
particularly characteristic of its author, in its form, subject-matter,
and the history of its origin. Whereas the poet gave skilful expression
to a fleeting mood in his song, the historian of literature sees in
it and beyond it, things which the poet would never have suspected.
The analysis which the literary critic makes of the subject-matter
furnished by the poet may be compared with psychoanalysis in its
method, even to the very errors which occur therein. The psychoanalytic
method may be aptly compared with historical analysis and synthesis.
Let us assume, for instance, that we do not understand the meaning of
the rite of baptism as it is practised in our churches to-day. The
priest tells us that baptism means the reception of the child into the
Christian community. But we are not satisfied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
this. Why should the child be sprinkled with water, etc.? In order
that we may understand this rite we must gather together materials for
comparison from the history of the rite, that is, from the memories of
mankind appertaining to it; and this must be done from various points
of view.</p>

<p>Firstly&mdash;Baptism is clearly a rite of initiation, a
consecration. Therefore those memories, above all, must be assembled
which preserve the rites of initiation.</p>

<p>Secondly&mdash;The act of baptism is performed with water. This
especial form of procedure proves the necessity of welding together
another chain of memories concerning rites in which water was used.</p>

<p>Thirdly&mdash;The child is sprinkled with water when it is
christened. In this case we must gather together all the forms of the
rite, where the neophyte is sprinkled or where the child is submerged,
etc.</p>

<p>Fourthly&mdash;We must recollect all the reminiscences in mythology
and all the superstitious customs which are in any respect similar to
the symbolic act of baptism.</p>

<p>In this manner we obtain a comparative study of the act of baptism.
Thus we ascertain the elements from which baptism is derived; we
further ascertain its original meaning, and at the same time make the
acquaintance of a world rich in religious mythology, which makes clear
to us all the multifarious and derived meanings of the act of baptism.
Thus the analyst deals with the dream. He gathers together historical
parallels for each dream part, even though they be very remote and
attempts to construct the psychological history of the dream and the
meanings that underlie it. By this monographic elaboration of the
dream one gains, exactly as in the analysis of the act of baptism, a
deep insight into the wonderfully subtle and significant network of
subconscious determinations; an insight which, as I have said, can
only be compared with the historical understanding of an act that we
used only to consider from a very one-sided and superficial point of
view.</p>

<p>I cannot disguise the fact that in practice, especially at
the beginning of an analysis, we do not in all cases make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
complete and ideal analyses of dreams, but that we more generally
continue to gather together the dream associations until the problem
which the patient hides from us becomes so clear that even he can
recognize it. This problem is then subjected to conscious elaboration
until it is cleared up as far as possible, and once again we stand
before a question that cannot be answered.</p>

<p>You will now ask what course is to be pursued when the patient does
not dream at all; I can assure you that hitherto all patients, even
those who claimed never to have dreamed before, began to dream when
they went through analysis. But on the other hand it frequently occurs
that patients who began by dreaming vividly are suddenly no longer
able to remember their dreams. The empirical and practical rule, which
I have hitherto regarded as binding, is that the patient, if he does
not dream, has sufficient conscious material, which he keeps back for
certain reasons. A common reason is: "I am in the doctor's hands and am
quite willing to be treated by him. But the doctor must do the work, I
shall remain passive in the matter."</p>

<p>Sometimes the resistances are of a more serious character. For
instance, persons who cannot admit certain morally grave sides to
their characters, project their deficiencies upon the doctor by calmly
presuming that he is more or less deficient morally, and that for this
reason they cannot communicate certain unpleasant things to him. If,
then a patient does not dream from the beginning or ceases to dream
he retains material which is susceptible of conscious elaboration.
Here the personal relation between the doctor and his patient may be
regarded as the chief hindrance. It can prevent them both, the doctor
as well as the patient, from seeing the situation clearly. We must not
forget that, as the doctor shows, and must show, a searching interest
in the psychology of his patient, so, too, the patient, if he has an
active mind, gains some familiarity with the psychology of the doctor
and assumes a corresponding attitude towards him. Thus the doctor is
blind to the mental attitude of the patient to the exact extent that he
does not see himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and his own subconscious problems. Therefore I maintain that a doctor
must be analysed before he practises analysis. Otherwise the practice
of analysis can easily be a great disappointment to him, because he
can, under certain circumstances, reach a point where further progress
is impossible, a situation which may make him lose his head. He is
then readily inclined to assume that psychoanalysis is nonsense, so
as to avoid the admission that he has run his vessel ashore. If you
are sure of your own psychology you can confidently tell your patient
that he does not dream because there is still conscious material to be
disposed of. I say that one must be sure of one's self in such cases,
for the opinions and unsparing criticisms to which one sometimes has to
submit, can be excessively disturbing to one who is unprepared to meet
them. The immediate consequence of such a loss of personal balance on
the part of the doctor is that he begins to argue with his patient, in
order to maintain his influence over him; and this, of course, renders
all further analysis impossible.</p>

<p>I have told you that, in the first instance, dreams need only
be used as sources of material for analysis. At the beginning of
an analysis it is not only unnecessary, but also unwise, to make a
so-called complete interpretation of a dream; for it is very difficult
indeed to make a complete and really exhaustive interpretation. The
interpretations of dreams that one sometimes reads in psychoanalytic
publications are often one-sided, and not infrequently contestable
formulations. I include among these certain one-sided sexual reductions
of the Viennese school. In view of the comprehensive many-sidedness
of the dream material one must beware, above all, of one-sided
formulations. The many-sidedness of the meaning of a dream, not its
singleness of meaning, is of the utmost value, especially at the
beginning of the psychoanalytic treatment. Thus, for instance, a
patient had the following dream not long after her treatment had begun:
"<em>She was in a hotel in a strange city. Suddenly a fire broke out; and
her husband and her father, who were with her, helped her in the work
of saving others.</em>" The patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
was intelligent, extraordinarily sceptical, and absolutely convinced
that dream analysis was nonsense. I had difficulty in inducing her to
give dream analysis even one trial. Indeed I saw at once that I could
not inform my patient of the real content of the dream under these
circumstances because her resistances were much too great. I selected
the fire, the most conspicuous occurrence of the dream, as the starting
point for obtaining her free associations. The patient told me that
she had recently read in a newspaper that a certain hotel in Z. had
been burnt down; that she remembered the hotel because she had once
lived in it. At the hotel she had made the acquaintance of a man, and
from this acquaintance a somewhat questionable love affair developed.
In connection with this story the fact came out that she had already
had quite a number of similar adventures, all of which had a certain
frivolous character. This important bit of past history was brought
out by the first free association with a dream-part. It would have
been impossible in this case to make clear to the patient the very
striking meaning of the dream. With her frivolous mental attitude, of
which her scepticism was only a special instance, she could have calmly
repelled any attempt of this kind. But after the frivolity of her
mental attitude was recognised and proved to her, by the material that
she herself had furnished, it was possible to analyse the dreams which
followed much more thoroughly.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, advisable in the beginning to make use of dreams
for the purpose of reaching the important subconscious material by
means of the patient's free associations in connection with them. This
is the best and most cautious method, especially for those who are just
beginning to practise analysis. An arbitrary translation of the dreams
is absolutely unadvisable. That would be a superstitious practice based
on the acceptance of well-established symbolic meanings. But there
are no fixed symbolic meanings. There are certain symbols that recur
frequently, but we are not able to get beyond general statements. For
instance, it is quite incorrect to assume that the snake, when it
appears in dreams, has a merely phallic meaning; just as incorrect as
it is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
deny that it may have a phallic meaning in some cases. Every symbol
has more than one meaning. I can therefore not admit the correctness
of exclusively sexual interpretations, such as appear in some
psychoanalytic publications, for my experience has made me regard them
as one-sided and therefore insufficient. As an example of this I will
tell you a very simple dream of a young patient of mine. It was as
follows: "<em>I was going up a flight of stairs with my mother and sister.
When we reached the top I was told that my sister was soon to have a
child.</em>"</p>

<p>I shall now show you how, on the strength of the hitherto prevailing
point of view, this dream may be translated so that it receives a
sexual meaning. We know that the incest phantasy plays a prominent
part in the life of a neurotic. Hence the picture "with my mother
and sister" might be regarded as an allusion in this direction. The
"stairs" have a sexual meaning that is supposedly well established;
they represent the sexual act because of the rhythmic climbing of
steps. The child that my patient's sister is expecting is nothing but
the logical result of these premises. The dream, translated thus, would
be a clear fulfilment of infantile desires which as we know play an
important part in Freud's theory of dreams.</p>

<p>Now I have analysed this with the aid of the following process of
reasoning: If I say that the stairs are a symbol for the sexual act,
whence do I obtain the right to regard the mother, the sister, and the
child as concrete; that is, as not symbolic? If, on the strength of
the claim that dream pictures are symbolic, I give to certain of these
pictures the value of symbols, what right have I to exempt certain
other dream parts from this process? If, therefore, I attach symbolic
value to the ascent of the stairs, I must also attach a symbolic value
to the pictures that represent the mother, the sister, and the child.
Therefore I did not translate the dream, but really analysed it. The
result was surprising. I will give you the free associations with the
separate dream-parts, word for word, so that you can form your own
opinions concerning the material. I should state in advance that the
young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
had finished his studies at the university a few months previously;
that he found the choice of a profession too difficult to make; and
that he thereupon became a neurotic. In consequence of this he gave up
his work. His neurosis took, among other things, a decidedly homosexual
form.</p>

<p>The patient's associations with his mother are as follows: "I
have not seen her for a long time, a very long time. I really ought
to reproach myself for this. It is wrong of me to neglect her so."
"Mother," then, stands here for something which is neglected in an
inexcusable manner. I said to the patient: "What is that?" And he
replied, with considerable embarrassment, "My work."</p>

<p>With his sister he associated as follows: "It is years since I have
seen her. I long to see her again. Whenever I think of her I recall the
time when I took leave of her. I kissed her with real affection; and at
that moment I understood for the first time what love for a woman can
mean." It is at once clear to the patient that his sister represents
"love for woman."</p>

<p>With the stairs he has this association: "Climbing upwards; getting
to the top; making a success of life; being grown up; being great." The
child brings him the ideas: "New born; a revival; a regeneration; to
become a new man."</p>

<p>One only has to hear this material in order to understand at once
that the patient's dream is not so much the fulfilment of infantile
desires, as it is the expression of biological duties which he has
hitherto neglected because of his infantilism. Biological justice,
which is inexorable, sometimes compels the human being to atone in his
dreams for the duties which he has neglected in real life.</p>

<p>This dream is a typical example of the prospective and teleological
function of dreams in general, a function that has been especially
emphasised by my colleague Dr. Maeder. If we adhered to the
one-sidedness of sexual interpretation, the real meaning of the dream
would escape us. Sexuality in dreams is, in the first instance, a means
of expression, and by no means always the meaning and the object of the
dream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
The unfolding of the prospective or teleological meaning of dreams is
of particular importance as soon as analysis is so far advanced that
the eyes of the patient are more easily turned upon the future, than
upon his inner life and upon the past.</p>

<p>In connection with the application of symbolism, we can also learn
from the example furnished us by this dream, that there can be no fixed
and unalterable dream symbols, but at best a frequent repetition of
fairly general meanings. So far as the so-called sexual meaning of
dreams, in particular, is concerned, my experience has led me to lay
down the following practical rules:</p>

<p>If dream analysis at the beginning of the treatment shows that the
dream has an undoubted sexual meaning, this meaning is to be taken
realistically; that is, it is proved thereby that the sexual problem
itself must be subjected to a careful revision. If, for instance, an
incest phantasy is clearly shown to be a latent content of the dream,
one must subject the patient's infantile relations towards his parents
and his brothers and sisters, as well as his relations towards other
persons who are fitted to play the part of his father or mother in his
mind, to a careful examination on this basis. But if a dream that comes
in a later stage of the analysis has, let us say, an incest phantasy
as its essential content, a phantasy that we have reason to consider
disposed of, concrete value must not be attached to it under all
circumstances; it must be regarded as symbolic. In this case symbolic
value, not concrete value, must be attached to the sexual phantasy. If
we did not go beyond the concrete value in this case, we should keep
reducing the patient to sexuality, and this would arrest the progress
of the development of his personality. The patient's salvation is not
to be found by thrusting him back again into primitive sexuality; this
would leave him on a low plane of civilisation whence he could never
obtain freedom and complete restoration to health. Retrogression to
a state of barbarism is no advantage at all for a civilised human
being.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned formula, according to which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sexuality of a dream is a symbolic or analogous expression, naturally
also holds good in the case of dreams occurring in the beginning of
an analysis. But the practical reasons that have induced us not to
take into consideration the symbolic value of this sexual phantasy,
owe their existence to the fact that a genuine realistic value must be
given to the abnormal sexual phantasies of a neurotic, in so far as
the latter suffers himself to be influenced in his actions by these
phantasies. Experience teaches us that these phantasies not only hinder
him from adapting himself suitably to his situation, but that they also
lead him to all manner of really sexual acts, and occasionally even
to incest. Under these circumstances, it would be of little use to
consider the symbolic content of the dream only; the concrete content
must first be disposed of.</p>

<p>These arguments are based upon a different conception of the dream
from that put forward by Freud; for, indeed, my experience has forced
me to a different conception. According to Freud, the dream is in its
essence a symbolic veil for repressed desires which are in conflict
with the ideals of the personality. I am obliged to regard the dream
structure from a different point of view. The dream for me is, in the
first instance, the subliminal picture of the psychological condition
of the individual in his waking state. It presents a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">résumé</i> of the
subliminal association material which is brought together by the
momentary psychological situation. The volitional meaning of the
dream which Freud calls the repressed desire, is, for me, essentially
a means of expression. The activity of the consciousness, speaking
biologically, represents the psychological effort which the individual
makes in adapting himself to the conditions of life. His consciousness
endeavours to adjust itself to the necessities of the moment, or, to
put it differently: there are tasks ahead of the individual, which he
must overcome. In many cases the solution is unknown; and for this
reason the consciousness always tries to find the solution by the way
of analogous experience. We always try to grasp what is unknown and
in the future, according to our mental understanding of what has gone
before. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
we have no reasons for assuming that the unconscious follows other laws
than those which apply to conscious thought. The unconscious, like the
conscious, gathers itself about the biological problems and endeavours
to find solutions for these by analogy with what has gone before,
just as much as the conscious does. Whenever we wish to assimilate
something that is unknown, we arrive at it by a process of comparison.
A simple example of this is the well-known fact that, when America
was discovered by the Spaniards, the Indians took the horses of the
conquerors, which were strange to them, for large pigs, because pigs
were familiar to their experience. This is the mental process which we
always employ in recognising unknown things; and this is the essential
reason for the existence of symbolism. It is a process of comprehension
by means of analogy. The apparently repressed desires, contained in the
dream, are volitional tendencies which serve as language-material for
subconscious expression. So far as this particular point is concerned,
I am in full accord with the views of Adler, another member of Freud's
school. With reference to the fact that subconscious materials of
expression are volitional elements or tendencies, I may say that this
is dependent upon the archaic nature of dream thinking, a problem with
which I have already dealt in previous researches.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Owing to our different conception of the structure of the dream,
the further course of analysis also gains a different complexion from
that which it had until now. The symbolic valuation given to sexual
phantasies in the later stages of analysis necessarily leads less to
the reduction of the patient's personality into primitive tendencies,
than to the extension and further development of his mental attitude;
that is, it tends to make his thinking richer and deeper, thus giving
him what has always been one of the most powerful weapons that a
human being can have in his struggle to adapt himself to life. By
following this new course logically, I have come to the conclusion that
these religious and philosophical motive forces&mdash;the so-called
metaphysical needs of the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
being&mdash;must receive positive consideration at the hands of the
analyst. Though he must not destroy the motive forces that underlie
them, by reducing them to their primitive, sexual roots, he must make
them serve biological ends as psychologically valuable factors. Thus
these instincts assume once more those functions that have been theirs
from time immemorial.</p>

<p>Just as primitive man was able, with the aid of religious and
philosophical symbol, to free himself from his original state, so, too,
the neurotic can shake off his illness in a similar way. It is hardly
necessary for me to say, that I do not mean by this, that the belief in
a religious or philosophical dogma should be thrust upon the patient; I
mean simply that he has to reassume that psychological attitude which,
in an earlier civilisation, was characterised by the living belief in
a religious or philosophical dogma. But the religious-philosophical
attitude does not necessarily correspond to the belief in a dogma. A
dogma is a transitory intellectual formulation; it is the result of
the religious-philosophical attitude, and is dependent upon time and
circumstances. This attitude is itself an achievement of civilization;
it is a function that is exceedingly valuable from a biological point
of view, for it gives rise to the incentives that force human beings to
do creative work for the benefit of a future age, and, if necessary, to
sacrifice themselves for the welfare of the species.</p>

<p>Thus the human being attains the same sense of unity and totality,
the same confidence, the same capacity for self-sacrifice in his
conscious existence that belongs unconsciously and instinctively to
wild animals. Every reduction, every digression from the course that
has been laid down for the development of civilisation does nothing
more than turn the human being into a crippled animal; it never makes
a so-called natural man of him. My numerous successes and failures in
the course of my analytic practice have convinced me of the invariable
correctness of this psychological orientation. We do not help the
neurotic patient by freeing him from the demand made by civilisation;
we can only help him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
by inducing him to take an active part in the strenuous task of
carrying on the development of civilisation. The suffering which he
undergoes in performing this duty takes the place of his neurosis.
But, whereas the neurosis and the complaints that accompany it are
never followed by the delicious feeling of good work well done, of duty
fearlessly performed, the suffering that comes from useful work, and
from victory over real difficulties, brings with it those moments of
peace and satisfaction which give the human being the priceless feeling
that he has really lived his life.</p>

<p class="p3">ON PSYCHOANALYSIS<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>


<p>After many years' experience I now know that it is extremely
difficult to discuss psychoanalysis at public meetings and at
congresses. There are so many misconceptions of the matter, so many
prejudices against certain psychoanalytic views, that it becomes
an almost impossible task to reach mutual understanding in public
discussion. I have always found a quiet conversation on the subject
much more useful and fruitful than heated discussions <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">coram publico</i>.
However, having been honoured by an invitation from the Committee of
this Congress as a representative of the psychoanalytic movement,
I will do my best to discuss some of the fundamental theoretical
conceptions of psychoanalysis. I must limit myself to this part of the
subject because I am quite unable to place before my audience all that
psychoanalysis means and strives for, all its various applications,
its psychology, its theoretical tendencies, its importance for the
realm of the so-called "Geisteswissenschaften," <i>e.g.</i> Mythology,
Comparative Religion, Philosophy, &amp;c. But if I am to discuss
certain theoretical problems fundamental to psychoanalysis, I must
presuppose my audience to be well acquainted with the development and
main results of psychoanalytic researches. Unfortunately, it often
happens that people believe themselves entitled to judge psychoanalysis
who have not even read the literature. It is my firm conviction that no
one is competent to form a judgment concerning the subject until he has
studied the fundamental works on psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that Freud's theory of neurosis has
been worked out in great detail, it cannot be said to be, on the
whole, very clear or easily accessible. This justifies my giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
you a very short abstract of his fundamental views concerning
the theory of neurosis.</p>

<p>You are aware that the original theory that hysteria and
the related neuroses take their origin in a trauma or shock of
sexual character in early childhood, was given up about fifteen
years ago. It soon became obvious that the sexual trauma
could not be the real cause of a neurosis, since trauma is found
so universally; there is scarcely a human being who has not
had some sexual shock in early youth, and yet comparatively
few have incurred a neurosis in later life. Freud
himself soon became aware that several of the patients who
related an early traumatic event, had only invented the
story of a so-called trauma; it had never taken place in
reality, and was a mere creation of phantasy. Moreover,
on further investigation it became quite obvious that even
a trauma which had actually occurred was not always responsible
for the whole of the neurosis, although it does
sometimes look as if the structure of the neurosis depended
entirely upon the trauma. If a neurosis were the inevitable
consequence of a trauma it would be quite incomprehensible
why neurotics are not incomparably more numerous.</p>

<p>This apparently heightened shock-effect was clearly based
upon the <em>exaggerated and morbid phantasy</em> of the patient. Freud
also saw that this same phantasy manifested itself in relatively
early bad habits, which he called infantile perversities. His
new conception of the ætiology of a neurosis was based upon
this further understanding and traced the neurosis back to
some sexual activity in early infancy; this conception led on
to his recent view that the neurotic is "fixed" to a certain
period of his early infancy, because he still seems to preserve
some trace of it, direct or indirect, in his mental attitude.
Freud also makes the attempt to classify or to differentiate
the neuroses, including dementia præcox, according to the
stage of the infantile development in which the fixation took
place.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of this theory, the neurotic appears
to be entirely dependent upon his infantile past, and all his
troubles in later life, his moral conflicts, and deficiencies, seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to be derived from the powerful influence of that period. The
therapy and its main preoccupation are in full accord with
this view, and are chiefly concerned with the unravelling of
this infantile fixation, which is understood as an unconscious
attachment of the sexual libido to certain infantile phantasies
and habits.</p>

<p>This is, so far as I can see, the essence of Freud's theory. But
this conception neglects the following important question: What is the
cause of this fixation of the libido to the old infantile phantasies
and habits? We have to remember that almost all persons have at some
time had infantile phantasies and habits exactly corresponding to those
of a neurotic, but they do not become fixed to them; consequently,
they do not become neurotic later on. The ætiological secret of the
neurosis, therefore, does not consist in the mere <em>existence</em>
of infantile phantasies, but lies in the so-called <em>fixation</em>.
The manifold statements of the existence of infantile sexual phantasies
in neurotic cases are worthless, in so far as they attribute an
ætiological value to them, for the same phantasies can be found in
normal individuals as well, a fact which I have often proved. It is
only the fixation which seems to be characteristic. It is important
to demand the nature of the proofs of the real existence of this
infantile fixation. Freud, an absolutely sincere and thorough
empiricist, would never have evolved this hypothesis had he not had
sufficient grounds for it. The grounds are found in the results of
the psychoanalytic investigations of the unconscious. Psychoanalysis
discloses the unconscious existence of manifold phantasies, which have
their end root in the infantile past and turn around the so-called
"<em>Kern-complex</em>," or nucleus-complex, which may be designated
in male individuals as the &OElig;dipus-complex and in females as the
Electra-complex. These terms convey their own meaning exactly. The
whole tragic fate of &OElig;dipus and Electra took place within the
narrow confines of the family, just as the child's fate lies wholly
within the family boundaries. Hence the &OElig;dipus conflict is
very characteristic of an infantile conflict, so also is the Electra
conflict. The existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of these conflicts in infancy is largely proven by means of
psychoanalytic experience. It is in the realm of this complex
that the fixation is supposed to have taken place. Through
the highly potent and effective existence of the nucleus-complex
in the unconscious of neurotics, Freud was led to
the hypothesis, that the neurotic has a peculiar fixation or
attachment to it. Not the mere existence of this complex&mdash;for
everybody has it in the unconscious&mdash;but the very strong
attachment to it is what is typical of the neurotic. He is far
more influenced by this complex than the normal person;
many examples in confirmation of this statement will be
found in every one of the recent psychoanalytic histories of
neurotic cases.</p>

<p>We must admit that this conception is a very plausible
one, because the hypothesis of fixation is based upon the
well-known fact, that certain periods of human life, and particularly
infancy, do sometimes leave determining traces for
ever. The only question is whether this principle is a
sufficient explanation or not. If we examine persons who
have been neurotic from infancy it seems to be confirmed,
for we see the nucleus-complex as a permanent and powerful
activity throughout the whole life. But if we take cases
which never show any considerable traces of neurosis except
at the particular time when they break down, and there are
many such, this principle becomes doubtful. If there is such
a thing as fixation, it is not permissible to base upon it
a new hypothesis, claiming that at times during certain
epochs of life the fixation becomes loosened and ineffective,
while at others it suddenly becomes strengthened and effective.
In such cases we find the nucleus-complex as active and as
potent as in those which apparently support the theory of
fixation. Here a critical attitude is peculiarly justifiable, when
we consider the often-repeated observation that the moment
of the outbreak of the disease is by no means indifferent; as
a rule it is most critical. It usually occurs <em>at the moment
when a new psychological adjustment, that is, a new adaptation,
is demanded</em>. Such moments facilitate the outbreak of a
neurosis, as every experienced neurologist knows. This fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
seems to me extremely significant. If the fixation were indeed
real we should expect to find its influence constant, <i>i.e.</i> a
neurosis continuous throughout life. This is obviously not the
case. The psychological determination of a neurosis is only
partially due to an early infantile predisposition; it is due to
a certain actual cause as well. And if we carefully examine
the kind of infantile phantasies and events to which the neurotic
individual is attached, we shall be obliged to agree that there
is nothing in them specific for neurosis. Normal individuals
have pretty much the same kind of internal and external experiences,
and are attached to them to an even astonishing
degree, without developing a neurosis. You will find primitive
people, especially, very much bound to their infantility. It
now begins to look as if this so-called fixation were a normal
phenomenon, and that the importance of infancy for the
later mental attitude is natural and prevails everywhere. The
fact that the neurotic seems to be markedly influenced by his
infantile conflicts, shows that it is less a matter of fixation
than of a peculiar use which he makes of his infantile past.
It looks as if he exaggerated its importance, and attributed
a very great artificial value to it (Adler, a pupil of Freud's,
expresses a very similar view). It would be unjust to say
that Freud confined himself to the hypothesis of fixation; he
also was conscious of the impression I have just discussed.
He called this phenomenon of reactivation or secondary exaggeration
of infantile reminiscences "regression." But in
Freud's conception it appears as if the incestuous desires of
the &OElig;dipus-complex were the real cause of the regression to
infantile phantasies. If this were the case, we should have
to postulate an unexpected intensity of the primary incestuous
tendencies. This view led Freud to his recent comparison
between the so-called psychological "incest-barrier"
in children and the "incest-taboo" in primitive man. He
supposes that a real incestuous desire has led the primitive
man to the invention of a protective law; while to me it looks
as if the incest-taboo is one among numerous taboos of all
sorts, and due to the typical superstitious fear of primitive
man, a fear existing independently of incest and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
interdiction. I am able to attribute as little particular strength to
incestuous desires in childhood as in primitive humanity. I do not
even seek the reason for regression in primary incestuous or any other
sexual desires. I must state that a purely sexual ætiology of neurosis
seems to me much too narrow. I base this criticism upon no prejudice
against sexuality, but upon an intimate acquaintance with the whole
problem.</p>

<p>Therefore I suggest that the psychoanalytic theory should be
liberated from the purely sexual standpoint. In place of it I should
like to introduce an <em>energic view-point</em> into the psychology of
neurosis.</p>

<p>All psychological phenomena can be considered as manifestations
of energy, in the same way as all physical phenomena are already
understood as energic manifestations since Robert Mayer discovered
the law of the conservation of energy. This energy is subjectively
and psychologically conceived as <em>desire</em>. I call it
<em>libido</em>, using the word in the original meaning of this term,
which is by no means only sexual. Sallustius applies the term exactly
in the way we do here: "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Magis in armis et militaribus equis, quam in
scortis et conviviis libidinem habebant.</i>"</p>

<p>From a broader standpoint libido can be understood as vital energy
in general, or as Bergson's <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">élan vital</i>. The first manifestation of
this energy in the suckling is the instinct of <em>nutrition</em>. From this
stage the libido slowly develops through manifold varieties of the
act of sucking into the sexual function. Hence I do not consider the
act of sucking as a sexual act. The pleasure in sucking can certainly
not be considered as sexual pleasure, but as pleasure in nutrition,
for it is nowhere proved that pleasure is sexual in itself. This
process of development continues into adult life and is connected with
a constantly increased adaptation to the external world. Whenever
the libido, in the process of adaptation, meets an obstacle, an
accumulation takes place which normally gives rise to an increased
effort to overcome the obstacle. But if the obstacle seems to be
insurmountable, and the individual renounces the overcoming of it, the
stored-up libido makes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
regression. In place of being employed in the increased
effort, the libido now gives up the present task and returns
to a former and more primitive way of adaptation. We meet
with the best examples of such regressions very frequently in
hysterical cases where a disappointment in love or marriage
gives rise to the neurosis. There we find the well-known disturbances
of nutrition, resistance against eating, dyspeptic
symptoms of all sorts, etc. In these cases the regressive
libido, turning away from its application to the work of
adaptation, holds sway over the function of nutrition and
provokes considerable disturbance. Such cases are obvious
examples of regression. Similar effects of regression are to be
found in cases where there are no troubles in the function of
nutrition, and here we readily find a regressive revival of
reminiscences of a time long past. We find a revival of the
images of the parents, of the &OElig;dipus-complex. Here things
and events of infancy&mdash;never before important&mdash;suddenly
become so. They are regressively reanimated. Take away
the obstacle in the path of life and this whole system of
infantile phantasies at once breaks down and becomes again
as inactive and as ineffective as before. But do not let us
forget that, to a certain extent, it is at work influencing us
always and everywhere. I cannot forbear to mention that
this view comes very near Janet's hypothesis of the substitution
of the "parties supérieures" of a function by its
"parties inférieures." I would also remind you of Claparède's
conception of neurotic symptoms as emotional reflexes of a
primitive nature.</p>

<p>Therefore I no longer find the cause of a neurosis in the
past, but in the present. I ask, what is the necessary task
which the patient will not accomplish? The whole list of his
infantile phantasies does not give me any sufficient ætiological
explanation, because I know that these phantasies are only
puffed up by the regressive libido, which has not found
its natural outlet into a new form of adjustment to the demands
of life.</p>

<p>You may ask why the neurotic has a special inclination not
to accomplish his necessary tasks. Here let me point out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
that no living being adjusts itself easily and smoothly to new
conditions. The principle of the <em>minimum of effort</em> is valid
everywhere.</p>

<p>A sensitive and somewhat inharmonious character, as a
neurotic always is, will meet special difficulties and perhaps
more unusual tasks in life than a normal individual, who as
a rule has only to follow the well-established line of an
ordinary life. For the neurotic there is no established way,
for his aims and tasks are apt to be of a highly individual
character. He tries to follow the more or less uncontrolled
and half-conscious way of normal people, not fully realizing
his own critical and very different nature, which imposes upon
him more effort than the normal person is required to exert.
There are neurotics who have shown their increased sensitiveness
and their resistance against adaptation in the very
first weeks of life, in their difficulty in taking the mother's
breast, and in their exaggerated nervous reactions, &amp;c. For
this portion of a neurotic predisposition it will always be
impossible to find a psychological ætiology, for it is anterior
to all psychology. But this predisposition&mdash;you may call it
"congenital sensitiveness" or by what name you like&mdash;is the
cause of the first resistances against adaptation. In such case,
the way of adaptation being blocked, the biological energy we
call libido does not find its appropriate outlet or activity and
therefore replaces an up-to-date and suitable form of adaptation
by an abnormal or primitive one.</p>

<p>In neurosis we speak of an infantile attitude or the predominance
of infantile phantasies and desires. In so far as
infantile impressions and desires are of obvious importance
in normal people they are equally influential in neurosis, but
they have here no ætiological significance, they are reactions
merely, being chiefly secondary and regressive phenomena.
It is perfectly true, as Freud states, that infantile phantasies
determine the form and further development of neurosis, but
this is not ætiology. Even when we find perverted sexual
phantasies of which we can prove the existence in childhood,
we cannot consider them of ætiological significance. A neurosis
is not really originated by infantile sexual phantasies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and the same must be said of the sexualism of neurotic
phantasy in general. It is not a primary phenomenon based
upon a perverted sexual disposition, but merely secondary
and a consequence of a failure to apply the stored-up libido
in a suitable way. I realize that this is a very old view, but
this does not prevent its being true. The fact that the patient
himself very often believes that this infantile phantasy is the
real cause of the neurosis, does not prove that he is right in
his belief, or that a theory following the same belief is right
either. It may look as if it were so, and I must confess that
indeed very many cases do have that appearance. At all
events, it is perfectly easy to understand how Freud came to
this view. Every one having any psychoanalytic experience
will agree with me here.</p>

<p>To sum up: I cannot see the real ætiology of a neurosis
in the various manifestations of infantile sexual development
and their corresponding phantasies. The fact that they are
exaggerated and put into the foreground in neurosis is a
consequence of the stored-up energy or libido. The psychological
trouble in neurosis, and neurosis itself, can be
considered <em>as an act of adaptation that has failed</em>. This formulation
might reconcile certain views of Janet's with Freud's
view, that a neurosis is&mdash;under a certain aspect&mdash;an attempt
at self-cure; a view which can be and has been applied to
many diseases.</p>

<p>Here the question arises whether it is still advisable to
bring to light all the patient's phantasies by analysis, if we
now consider them as of no ætiological significance. Psychoanalysis
hitherto has proceeded to the unravelling of these
phantasies because they were considered to be ætiologically
significant. My altered view concerning the theory of
neurosis does not change the procedure of psychoanalysis.
The technique remains the same. We no longer imagine
we are unearthing the end-root of the disease, but we have
to pull up the sexual phantasies because the energy which
the patient needs for his health, that is, for his adaptation,
is attached to them. By means of psychoanalysis
the connexion between the conscious and the libido in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
unconscious is re-established. Thus you restore this unconscious
libido to the command of conscious intention.
Only in this way can the formerly split-off energy become
again applicable to the accomplishment of the necessary
tasks of life. Considered from this standpoint, psychoanalysis
no longer appears to be a mere reduction of the
individual to his primitive sexual wishes, but it becomes
clear that, if rightly understood, it is a <em>highly moral task of
immense educational value</em>.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="center"><em>From Dr. Loÿ.</em></p>

<p class="center">12th January, 1913.</p>

<p>What you said at our last conversation was extraordinarily
stimulating. I was expecting you to throw light upon the
interpretation of my own and my patients' dreams from the
standpoint of Freud's "Interpretation of Dreams." Instead,
you put before me an entirely new conception: the dream as
a means of re-establishing the moral equipoise, fashioned in
the realm below the threshold of consciousness. That indeed
is a fruitful conception. But still more fruitful appears
to me your other suggestion. You regard the problems
of psychoanalysis as much deeper than I had ever thought:
it is no longer merely a question of getting rid of troublesome
pathological symptoms; the analysed person gets to
understand not his anxiety-experiences alone, but his whole
self most completely, and by means of this understanding
he can build up and fashion his whole life anew. But he
himself must be the builder, the Analyst only furnishes him
with the necessary tools.</p>

<p>To begin with, I would ask you to consider what justification
there is for the original procedure of Breuer and
Freud, now entirely given up both by Freud himself and by
you, but practised by Frank, for instance, as his only
method: I mean "the abreaction of the inhibited effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
under light hypnosis." Why have you given up the cathartic
method? More particularly, has light hypnosis in psychocatharsis
a different value from suggestion during sleep, long
customary in treatment by suggestion? that is, has it only
the value which the suggestionist contributes, or does it
claim to possess only the value which the patient's belief
bestows upon it? Or, again, is suggestion in the waking-state
equivalent to suggestion in hypnoidal states? This
Bernheim now asserts to be the case, after having used suggestion
for many years exclusively in hypnosis. You will
tell me we must talk of psychoanalysis, not of suggestion.
But I really mean this: is not the <em>suggestion</em>, by means of
which the psychocatharsis in the hypnoidal state produces
therapeutic effects, (modified naturally, by the patients' age,
etc.) the main factor in the therapeutic success of the psychocatharsis?
Frank, in his "<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Affektstörungen</i>," says: "these
partial adjustments of effect, suggestibility and suggestion,
are almost altogether omitted in the psychocathartic treatment
in light sleep, in so far as the content of the reproduced
presentations is concerned." Is that really true? Frank
himself adds: "How can meditation upon the dreams of
youth in itself lead to the discharge of the stored-up anxiety,
whether in hypnoidal states or under any other conditions?
Must one not suppose, with much greater probability, that
the anxiety-states would become more pronounced through
such concentration upon them?" [I have noticed that myself,
and much more than I at all liked.] One does indeed
say to the patient: "First we must stir up, then afterwards
comes peace." And it does come. But does it not
come <em>in spite of the stirring-up process</em>, because gradually, by
means of frequent talks under light hypnosis, the patient
gets such confidence in the doctor that he becomes susceptible
to direct suggestion, and that produces at first improvement
and finally, cure? I go still further: in an analysis
<em>in the waking-state</em>, is not the patient's belief that the <em>method
employed will cure him</em>, coupled with his ever-growing trust in
the doctor, a main cause of his cure? And I ask even
further: in every systematically carried-out therapeutic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
treatment, is not faith in it, trust in the doctor, a main
factor in its success? I will not indeed say the only factor,
for one cannot deny that the physical, dietetic and chemical
procedures, when properly selected, have a real effect in
securing a cure, over and above the obvious effect of their
indirect suggestion.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p class="center"><em>From Dr. Jung.</em></p>

<p class="center">28th January, 1913.</p>

<p>With regard to your question as to the applicability of the
cathartic method, the following is my standpoint: every
method is good if it serves its purpose, including every
method of suggestion, even Christian Science, Mental
Healing, etc. "<em>A truth is a truth, when it works.</em>" It is quite
another question whether a scientific physician can answer
for it to his conscience should he sell little bottles of Lourdes-water
because that suggestion is at times very useful. Even
the so-called highly scientific suggestion-therapy employs
the wares of the medicine-man and the exorcising Schaman.
And please, why should it not? The public is not even now
much more advanced and continues to expect miracles from
the doctor. And truly those doctors should be deemed
clever&mdash;worldly-wise in every respect&mdash;who understand the
art of investing themselves with the halo of the medicine-man.
Not only have they the biggest practices&mdash;they have
also the best results. This is simply because countless
physical maladies (leaving out of count the neuroses) are
complicated and burdened with psychic elements to an
extent scarcely yet suspected. The medical exorcist's whole
behaviour betrays his full valuation of the psychic element
when he gives the patient the opportunity of fixing his faith
firmly upon the doctor's mysterious personality. Thus does he
win the sick man's mind, which henceforth helps him indeed
to restore his body also to health. The cure works best
when the doctor really believes in his own formulæ, otherwise
he may be overcome by scientific doubt and so lose the correct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
convincing tone. I, too, for a time practised hypnotic
suggestion enthusiastically. But there befell me three
dubious incidents which I want you to note:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Once there came to me to be hypnotised for various
neurotic troubles a withered peasant-woman of some fifty
years old. She was not easy to hypnotise, was very restless,
kept opening her eyes&mdash;but at last I did succeed. When I
waked her after about half an hour she seized my hand and
with many words testified to her overflowing gratitude. I
said: "But you are by no means cured yet, so keep your
thanks till the end of the treatment." She: "I am not
thanking you for that, but&mdash;(blushing and whispering)&mdash;because
you have been so <em>decent</em>." So she said, looked at
me with a sort of tender admiration and departed. I gazed
long at the spot where she had stood&mdash;and asked myself, confounded,
"So decent?"&mdash;good heavens! surely she hadn't
imagined, somehow or other.... This glimpse made me
suspect for the first time that possibly the loose-minded
person, by means of that notorious feminine (I should at
that time have said "animal") directness of instinct, understood
more about the essence of hypnotism than I with all
my knowledge of the scientific profundity of the text-books.
Therein lay my harmlessness.</p>

<p>2. Next came a pretty, coquettish, seventeen-year-old girl
with a harassed, suspicious mother. The young daughter had
suffered since early girlhood from <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">enuresis nocturna</i>, which,
among other difficulties, hindered her from going to a
boarding-school abroad.</p>

<p>At once I thought of the old woman and her wisdom.
I tried to hypnotise the girl; she laughed affectedly and
prevented hypnosis for twenty minutes. Of course I kept
quiet and thought: I know why you laugh; you have already
fallen in love with me, but I will give you proof of my
decency in gratitude for your wasting my time with your
challenging laughter. I succeeded in hypnotising her.
Success followed at once. The enuresis stopped, and I therefore
informed the young lady later that, instead of Wednesday,
I would not see her again for hypnosis till the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Saturday. On Saturday she arrived with a cross countenance,
presaging failure. The enuresis had come back again. I
remembered my wise old woman, and asked: "When did the
enuresis return?" She (unsuspecting), "Wednesday night."
I thought to myself, There it is again, she wants to show me
that I simply must see her on Wednesdays too; not to see me
for a whole long week is too much for a tender, loving heart.
But I was quite resolved to give no help to such annoying
romancing, so I said, "To continue the hypnosis would be
quite wrong under these circumstances. We must drop it
for quite three weeks, to give the enuresis a chance to stop.
Then come again for treatment." In my malicious heart I
knew I should then be on my holiday and so the course of
hypnotic treatment would come to an end. After the holidays
my <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">locum tenens</i> told me the young lady had been there with
the news that the enuresis had vanished, but her disappointment
at not seeing me was very keen. The old woman was
right, thought I.</p>

<p>3. The third case gave my joy in suggestion its death-blow.
This was the manner of it. She was a lady of
sixty-five who came stumbling into the consulting-room with
a crutch. She had suffered from pain in the knee-joint for
seventeen years, and this at times kept her in bed for many
weeks. No doctor had been able to cure her, and she had
tried every possible remedy of present-day medicine. After I
had suffered the stream of her narrative to flow over me
for some ten minutes, I said, "I will try to hypnotise you,
perhaps that will do you good." She, "Oh yes, please do!"
leaned her head on one side and fell asleep before ever I
said or did anything. She passed into somnambulism and
showed every form of hypnosis you could possibly desire.
After half an hour I had the greatest difficulty in waking
her; when at last she was awake she jumped up: "I am
well, I am all right, you have cured me." I tried to make
timid objections, but her praises drowned me. She could
really walk. Then I blushed and said, embarrassed, to
my colleagues: "Look! behold the wondrously successful
hypnotic therapy." That day saw the death of my connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
with treatment by suggestion; the therapeutic praise won
by this case shamed and humiliated me. When, a year
later, at the beginning of my hypnotic course, the good old
lady returned, this time with the pain in her back, I was
already sunk in hopeless cynicism; I saw written on her
forehead that she had just read the notice of the re-opening
of my clinic in the newspaper, that vexatious romanticism
had provided her with a convenient pain in the back so that
she might have a pretext for seeing me, and again let herself
be cured in the same theatrical fashion. This proved true
in every particular.</p>

<p>As you will understand, a man possessed of scientific conscience
cannot endure such cases without embarrassment.
There ripened in me the resolve to renounce suggestion altogether
rather than to allow myself passively to be transformed
into a miracle-worker. I wanted to understand what really
went on in the souls of people. It suddenly seemed to me
incredibly childish to think of dispelling an illness with charms,
and that this should be the only result of our scientific
endeavours for a psychotherapy. Thus for me the discovery
of Breuer and Freud was a veritable deliverance. I took up
their method with unalloyed enthusiasm and soon recognised
how right Freud was, when at a very early date, indeed so
far back as the <cite>Studien ueber Hysterie</cite>, he began to direct
a searchlight upon the accompanying circumstances of the
so-called trauma. I too soon discovered that certainly some
traumata with an obvious etiological tinge are opportunely
present. But the greater number appeared highly improbable.
So many of them seemed so insignificant, even so
normal, that at most one could regard them as just providing
the opportunity for the neurosis to appear. But what
especially spurred my criticism was the fact that so many
traumata were simply inventions of phantasy which had
never really existed. This perception was enough to make
me sceptical about the whole trauma-theory. (But I have
dealt with these matters in detail in my lectures on the
theory of psychoanalysis).<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> I could no longer suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the hundred and one cathartic experiences of a phantastically
puffed-up or entirely invented trauma were anything but
the effect of suggestion. It is well enough if it helps. If
one only had not a scientific conscience and that impulsion
towards the truth! I found in many cases, especially when
dealing with more mentally gifted patients, that I must
recognise the therapeutic limitations of this method. It is,
of course, a definite plan, and convenient for the doctor,
since it makes no particular demands upon his intellect for
new adaptations. The theory and practice are both of the
pleasantest simplicity: "The neurosis is caused by a trauma.
The trauma is abreacted." When the abreaction takes place
under hypnotism, or with other magical accessories (dark
room, peculiar lighting, and the rest), I remember once
more the wise old woman, who opened my eyes not merely
to the magic influence of the mesmeric gestures, but also
to the essential character of hypnotism itself. But what
alienated me once for all from this relatively efficacious
indirect method of suggestion, based as it is upon an
equally efficacious false theory, was the perception I obtained
at the same time that, behind the confused deceptive
intricacies of neurotic phantasies, there stands a <em>conflict</em>,
which may be best described as a <em>moral</em> one. With this
there began for me a new era of understanding. Research
and therapy now coincided in the attempt to discover the
causes and the <em>rational</em> solution of this conflict. That is
what psychoanalysis meant to me. Whilst I had been
getting this insight, Freud had built up his sexual theory of
the neurosis, and therewith had brought forward an enormous
number of questions for discussion, all of which I thought
deserved the profoundest consideration. Thus I have had
the good fortune of co-operating with Freud for a long time,
and working with him in the investigation of the problem of
sexuality in neurosis. You, perhaps, know from some of my
earlier work that I was always dubious somewhat concerning
the significance of sexuality.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> This has now become the exact
point where I am no longer altogether of Freud's opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>I have preferred to answer your questions in rather non-sequent
fashion. Whatever is still unanswered, let me now
repeat: <em>light hypnosis</em> and <em>complete hypnosis</em> are but varying
grades of intensity of unconscious attraction towards the
hypnotist. Who can here venture to draw sharp distinctions?
To a critical intelligence it is unthinkable that
suggestibility and suggestion can be excluded in the cathartic
method. They are present everywhere and are universal
human attributes, even with Dubois and the psychoanalysts
who think they work on purely rational lines. <em>No technique,
no self-deception avails here&mdash;the doctor works, nolens volens&mdash;and
perhaps primarily&mdash;by means of his personality, that
is by suggestion.</em> In the cathartic treatment, what is of far
more importance to the patient than the conjuring up of old
phantasies is the being so often with the doctor, and having
confidence and belief in him personally, and in his method.
The belief, the self-confidence, perhaps also the devotion with
which the doctor does his work, are far more important things
to the patient (<em>imponderabilia</em> though they be) than the recalling
of old traumata.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Ultimately we shall some day know from the history
of medicine everything that has ever been of service; then
perhaps at last we may come to the really desirable therapy,
to psychotherapy. Did not even the old materia medica
of filth have brilliant cures?&mdash;cures which only faded away
with the belief in it!</p>

<p>Because I recognise that the patient does attempt to lay
hold of the doctor's personality, in spite of all possible rational
safeguards, I have formulated the demand that the psychotherapeutist
shall be held just as responsible for the cleanness
of his own hands as is the surgeon. I hold it to be an
absolutely indispensable preliminary that the psychoanalyst
should himself first undergo an analysis, for his personality
is one of the chief factors in the cure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Patients read the doctor's character intuitively and they
should find in him a human being, with faults indeed, but also
a man <em>who has striven at every point</em> to <em>fulfil his own human
duties in the fullest sense</em>. I think that this is the first healing
factor. Many times I have had the opportunity of seeing
that the analyst is successful with his treatment just in so far
as he has succeeded in his own moral development. I think
this answer will satisfy your question.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<h4>III</h4>

<p class="center"><em>From Dr. Loÿ.</em></p>

<p class="center">2nd February, 1913.</p>

<p>You answer several of my questions in a decidedly
affirmative sense. You take it as proved that in the cures by
the cathartic method the main <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> is played by faith in the
doctor and in his method, and not by the "abreaction" of
real or imaginary traumata. I also. Equally I am at one
with your view that the cures of the old materia medica of
filth, as well as the Lourdes cures, or those of the Mental
Healers, Christian Scientists and Persuasionists, are to be
attributed to faith in the miracle-worker, rather than to any
of the methods employed.</p>

<p>Now comes the ticklish point: the augur can remain an
augur so long as he himself believes the will of the gods is
made manifest by the entrails of the sacrificial beast. When
he no longer believes, he has to ask himself: Shall I continue
to use my augur's authority to further the welfare
of the State, or shall I make use of my newer, and (I
hope) truer convictions of to-day? Both ways are possible.
The first is called opportunism; the second the pursuit of
truth, and scientific honour. For a doctor, the first way
brings perhaps therapeutic success and fame; the second,
reproach: such a man is not taken seriously. What I
esteem most highly in Freud and his school is just this
passionate desire for truth. But again, it is precisely here
that people pronounce a different verdict: "It is impossible
for the busy practitioner to keep pace with the development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of the views of this investigator and his initiates." (Frank,
"Affektstörungen Einleitung.")</p>

<p>One can easily disregard this little quip, but one must
take more seriously one's self-criticism. We may have to ask
ourselves whether, since science is an undivided, ever-flowing
stream, we are justified in relinquishing on conscientious
grounds any method or combination of methods by means
of which we know cures can be achieved?</p>

<p>Looking more closely at the fundamental grounds of
your aversion to the use of hypnosis (or semi-hypnosis, the
degree matters nothing) in <em>treatment by suggestion</em>, (which as
a matter of fact every doctor and every therapeutic method
makes use of willy-nilly, no matter what it is called), it is
clear that what has disgusted you in hypnotism is at bottom
nothing but the so-called "transference" to the doctor, which
you, with your unalloyed psychoanalytic treatment, can get
rid of as little as any one else, for indeed it plays a
chief part in the success of the treatment. Your insistence
that the psychoanalyst must be answerable for the cleanness
of his own hands&mdash;(here I agree with you unreservedly)&mdash;&mdash;is
an inevitable conclusion. But, after all, does anything
more "augurish" really cling to the use made of
hypnosis in psychotherapeutic treatment, than to the quite
inevitable use made of the "transference to the doctor"
for therapeutic ends? In either case we must perforce
"take shares" in faith as a healing agent. As for the
feeling which the patient&mdash;whether man or woman&mdash;entertains
for the doctor, is there never anything in the background
save conscious or unconscious sexual desire? In
many cases your view is most certainly correct; more than
one woman has been frank enough to confess that the
beginning of hypnosis was accompanied by voluptuous pleasure.
But this is not true in all instances&mdash;or how would
you explain the underlying feeling in the hypnotising of one
animal by another, <i>e.g.</i> snake and bird? Surely you can say
that there the feeling of <em>fear</em> reigns, fear which is an inversion
of the libido, such as comes upon the bride in that hypnoidal
state before she yields to her husband wherein pure sexual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
desire rules, though possibly it contains an element of fear.
However this may be, from your three cases I cannot draw
any ethical distinction between the "unconscious readiness
towards the hypnotist" and the "transference to the doctor"
which should avail to condemn a combination of hypnotism
and psychoanalysis as a method of treatment. You will
ask why I cling to the use of hypnotism; or rather of
hypnoidal states. Because I think there are cases that
can be much more rapidly cured thereby, than through a
purely psychoanalytic treatment. For example, in no more
than five or six interviews I cured a fifteen-year-old girl who
had suffered from <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">enuresis nocturna</i> from infancy, but was
otherwise thoroughly healthy, gifted, and pre-eminent at
school: she had previously tried all sorts of treatment
without any result.</p>

<p>Perhaps I ought to have sought out the psychoanalytic
connexion between the enuresis and her psychosexual attitude
and explained it to her, etc., but I could not, she had
only the short Easter holidays for treatment: so I just
hypnotised her and the tiresome trouble vanished. It was a
lasting cure.</p>

<p>In psychoanalysis I use hypnosis to help the patient to
overcome "resistances."</p>

<p>Further, I use light hypnosis in association with psychoanalysis,
to hasten the advance when the "re-education"
stage comes.</p>

<p>For example, a patient afflicted with washing-mania was
sent to me after a year's psychocathartic treatment by
Dr. X. The symbolic meaning of her washing-ceremonial
was first made plain to her; she became more and more
agitated during the "abreaction" of alleged traumata in
childhood, because she had persuaded herself by auto-suggestion
that she was too old to be cured, that she saw no
"images," etc. So I used hypnosis to help her to diminish
the number of her washings, "so that the anxiety-feeling
would be banished"; and to train her to throw things on
the ground and pick them up again without washing her
hands afterwards, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>In view of these considerations, if you feel disposed
to go further into the matter, I should be grateful if you
would furnish me with more convincing reasons why hypnotic
treatment must be dispensed with; and explain how to do
without it, or with what to replace it in such cases. Were
I convinced, I would give it up as you have done, but
what convinced you has, so far, not convinced me. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Si duo
faciunt idem, non est idem.</i></p>

<p>Now I want to consider another important matter to which
you alluded, but only cursorily, and to put one question:
behind the neurotic phantasies there stands, you say, almost
always (or always) a moral conflict which belongs to the
present moment. That is perfectly clear to me. Research
and therapy coincide; their task is to search out the foundations
and the rational solution of the conflict. Good. But
can the rational solution always be found? "Reasons of
expediency" so often bar the way, varying with the type
of patient, for instance children, young girls and women
from "pious" catholic or protestant families. Again that
accursed opportunism! A colleague of mine was perfectly
right when he began to give sexual enlightenment to a young
French patient, a boy who was indulging in masturbation.
Whereupon, like one possessed, in rushed a bigoted grandmother,
and a disagreeable sequel ensued. How to act in
these and similar cases? What to do in cases where there
arises a moral conflict between love and duty (a conflict in
married life)?&mdash;or in general between instinct and moral
duty? What to do in the case of a girl afflicted with hysterical
or anxiety symptoms, needing love and having no
chance to marry, either because she cannot find a suitable
man or because, being "well-connected," she wants to
remain chaste? Simply try to get rid of the symptoms
by suggestion? But that is wrong as soon as one knows
of a better way. How to reconcile these two consciences:
that of the man who does not want to confine his fidelity
to truth within his own four walls; and that of the doctor
who must cure, or if he dare not cure according to his real
convictions (owing to opportunist-motives), must at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
procure some alleviation? We live in the present, but with
the ideas and ideals of the future. That is <em>our</em> conflict.
How resolve it?</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<h4>IV</h4>

<p class="center"><em>From Dr. Jung.</em></p>

<p class="center">4th February, 1913.</p>

<p>You have put me in some perplexity by the questions
in your yesterday's letter. You have rightly grasped the
spirit which dictated my last. I am glad you, too, recognise
this spirit. There are not very many who can boast of such
tolerance. I should deceive myself if I regarded my standpoint
as that of a practical physician. First and foremost
I am a scientist; naturally that gives me a different outlook
upon many problems. In my last letter I certainly left out
of count the doctor's practical needs, but chiefly that I might
show you on what grounds we might be moved to relinquish
hypnotic therapy. To remove the first objection at once, let
me say that I did not give up hypnotism because I desired to
avoid dealing with the basic motives of the human soul, but
rather because I wanted to battle with them <em>directly</em> and <em>openly</em>.
When once I understood what kind of forces play a part
in hypnotism I gave it up, simply to get rid of all the indirect
advantages of this method. As we psychoanalysts see regretfully
every day&mdash;and our patients also&mdash;<em>we do not work with
the "transference to the doctor,"</em><a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> <em>but against it and in spite of it</em>.
It is just not upon the <em>faith</em> of the sick man that we can
build, but upon his <em>criticism</em>. So much would I say at the
outset upon this delicate question.</p>

<p>As your letter shows, we are at one in regard to the
theoretical aspect of treatment by suggestion. So we can
now apply ourselves to the further task of coming to mutual
understanding about the practical question.</p>

<p>Your remarks on the physician's dilemma&mdash;whether to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
magician or scientist&mdash;bring us to the heart of the discussion.
I strive to be no fanatic&mdash;although there are not a few who
reproach me with fanaticism. I contend not for the application
of the psychoanalytic method solely and at all costs,
but for the recognition of every method of investigation and
treatment. I was a medical practitioner quite long enough to
realise that practice obeys, and should obey, other laws than
does the search after truth. One might almost say practice
must first and foremost submit to the laws of opportunism.
The scientist does great injustice to the practitioner if he
reproaches him for not using the "one true" scientific
method. As I said to you in my last letter: "A truth is a
truth, when it works." But on the other hand, the practitioner
must not reproach the scientist if in his search for
truth and for newer and better methods, he makes trial of
unusual ways. After all, it is not the practitioner but the
investigator, and the latter's patient, who will have to bear
any injury that may arise. The practitioner must certainly
use those methods which he knows how to use to greatest
advantage, and which give him the best relative results. My
tolerance, indeed, extends, as you see, even to Christian
Science. But I deem it most uncalled for that Frank, a
practising doctor, should depreciate research in which he
cannot participate, and particularly the very line of research
to which he owes his own method. It is surely time to cease
this running down of every new idea. No one asks Frank
and all whom he represents to become psychoanalysts; we
grant them the right to their existence, why should they always
seek to cut ours short?</p>

<p>As my own "cures" show you, I do not doubt the effect
of suggestion. Only I had the idea that I could perhaps
discover something still better. This hope has been amply
justified. Not for ever shall it be said&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The good attained is oft of fairer still</div>
  <div class="i0">The enemy, calling it vain illusion, falsehood's snare."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I confess frankly were I doing your work I should often be in
difficulties if I relied only on psychoanalysis. I can scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
imagine a general practice, especially in a sanatorium, with
no other means than psychoanalysis. At Dr. Bircher's
sanatorium in Zürich the principle of psychoanalysis is
adopted completely by several of the assistants, but a
whole series of other important educative influences are
also brought to bear upon the patients, without which
matters would probably go very badly. In my own purely
psychoanalytic practice I have often regretted that I could
not avail myself of the other methods of re-education that
are naturally at hand in an institution&mdash;this, of course, only
in special cases where one is dealing with extremely uncontrolled,
uneducated persons. Which of us has shown any
disposition to assert that we have discovered a panacea?
There are cases in which psychoanalysis operates less effectively
than any other known method. But who has ever
claimed psychoanalysis should be employed in every sort of
case, and on every occasion? Only a fanatic could maintain
such a view. Patients for whom psychoanalysis is suitable
have to be selected. I unhesitatingly send cases I think
unsuitable to other doctors. As a matter of fact this does
not happen often, because patients have a way of sorting
themselves out. Those who go to an analyst usually
know quite well why they go to him and not to some one
else. However, there are very many neurotics well suited
for psychoanalysis. In these matters every scheme must
be looked at in due perspective. It is never quite wise to
try to batter down a stone wall with your head. Whether
simple hypnotism, the cathartic treatment, or psychoanalysis
shall be used, must be determined by the conditions of the
case and the preference of the <em>particular</em> doctor. Every
doctor will obtain the best results with the instrument he
knows best.</p>

<p>But, barring exceptions, <em>I must say definitely that for me,
and for my patients also, psychoanalysis proves itself better than
any other method</em>. This is not merely a matter of feeling;
from manifold experiences I know many cases can indeed be
cured by psychoanalysis which are refractory to all other
methods of treatment. I have many colleagues whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
experience is the same, even men engaged exclusively in
practice. It is scarcely to be supposed that a method altogether
contemptible would meet with so much support.</p>

<p>When once psychoanalysis has been applied in a suitable
case, it is <em>imperative</em> that rational solutions of the conflicts
should be found. The objection is at once advanced that
many conflicts are intrinsically incapable of solution. That
view is sometimes taken because only an external solution
is thought of&mdash;and that, at bottom, is no real solution at all.
If a man cannot get on with his wife he naturally thinks the
conflict would be solved if he were to marry some one else.
If such marriages are examined they are seen to be no solution
whatsoever. The old Adam enters upon the new marriage
and bungles it just as badly as he did the earlier one. <em>A
real solution comes only from within, and only then because the
patient has been brought to a new standpoint.</em></p>

<p>Where an external solution is possible no psychoanalysis
is necessary; in seeking an internal solution we encounter
the peculiar virtues of psychoanalysis. The conflict between
"love and duty" must be solved upon that particular plane
of character where "love and duty" are no longer in opposition,
for indeed they really are not so. The familiar
conflict between "instinct and conventional morality" must be
solved in such a way that both factors are taken satisfactorily
into account, and this is only possible through a change of
character. This change psychoanalysis can bring about. In
such cases external solutions are worse than none at all.
Naturally the particular situation dictates which road the
doctor must ultimately follow, and what is then his duty.
I regard the conscience-searching question of the doctor's
remaining true to his scientific convictions as rather unimportant
in comparison with the incomparably weightier question
as to how he can best help his patient. The doctor <em>must</em>,
on occasion, be able to play the augur. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la"> Mundus vult decipi</i>&mdash;but
the cure is no deception. It is true that there is a
conflict between ideal conviction and concrete possibility.
<em>But we should ill prepare the ground for the seed of the future,
were we to forget the tasks of the present, and sought only to</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
<em>cultivate ideals.</em> That is but idle dreaming. Do not forget
that Kepler cast horoscopes for money, and that countless
artists have been condemned to work for wages.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p class="center"><em>From Dr. Loÿ.</em></p>

<p class="center">9th February, 1913.</p>

<p>The selfsame passion for truth possesses us both when
we think of pure research, and the same desire to cure when
we are considering therapy. For the scientist, as for the
doctor, we desire the fullest freedom in all directions, fullest
freedom to select and use the methods which promise the
best fulfilment of their ends at any moment. Here we are
at one; but there remains a postulate we must establish to
the satisfaction of others if we want recognition for our views.</p>

<p>First and foremost there is a question that must be
answered, an old question asked already in the Gospels:
<cite>What is Truth?</cite> I think clear definitions of fundamental
ideas are most necessary. How shall we contrive a working
definition of the conception "Truth"? Perhaps an allegory
may help us.</p>

<p>Imagine a gigantic prism extending in front of the sun,
so that its rays are broken up, but suppose man entirely
ignorant of this fact. I exclude the invisible, chemical and
ultra-violet rays. Men who live in a blue-lit region will say:
"The sun sends forth blue light only." They are right and
yet they are wrong: from their standpoint they are capable
of perceiving only a <em>fragment</em> of truth. And so too with the
inhabitants of the red, yellow, and in-between regions. And
they will all scourge and slay one another to force <em>their</em> belief
in <em>their</em> fragment upon the others&mdash;till, grown wiser through
travelling in each others' regions, they come to the harmonious
agreement that the sun sends out light of varying colours.
That comprehends more truth, but it is not yet <em>the</em> Truth.
Only when the giant lens shall have recombined the split-up
rays, and when the invisible, chemical and heat rays have
given proof of their own specific effects, will a view more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
in accordance with the facts be able to arise, and men will
perceive that the sun emits white light which is split up
by the prism into differing rays with different peculiarities,
which rays can be recombined by the lens into one mass
of white light.</p>

<p>This example shows sufficiently well that the road to
Truth leads through far-reaching and comparative observations,
the results of which must be controlled by the help of
freely chosen <em>experiments</em>, until well-grounded hypotheses and
theories can be put forward; but these hypotheses and
theories will fall to the ground as soon as a single new observation
or experiment contradicts them.</p>

<p>The way is difficult, and in the end all man ever attains
to is <em>relative</em> truth. But such relative truth suffices for the
time being, if it serves to explain the most important actual
concatenations of the past, to light up present problems,
to predict those of the future, so that we are then in a position
to achieve adaptation through our knowledge. But <em>absolute</em>
truth could be accessible only to omniscience, aware of
all possible concatenations and combinations; that is not
possible, for the concatenations and their combinations are
infinite. Accordingly, we shall never know more than an
approximate truth. Should new relationships be discovered,
new combinations built up, then the picture changes, and with
it the entire possibilities in knowledge and power. To what
revolutions in daily life does not every new scientific discovery
lead: how absurdly little was the beginning of our first ideas
of electricity, how inconceivably great the results! Time and
again it is necessary to repeat this commonplace, because one
sees how life is always made bitter for the innovators in every
scientific field, and now is it being made especially so for the
disciples of the psychoanalytic school. Of course, every one
admits the truth of this platitude so long as it is a matter
of "academic" discussion, but only so long; just as soon
as a concrete case has to be considered, sympathies and
antipathies rush into the foreground and darken judgment.
And therefore the scientist must fight tirelessly, appealing to
logic and honour, for freedom of research in every field, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
must not permit authority, of no matter what political or
religious tinge, to advance reasons of <em>opportunism</em> to destroy
or restrict this freedom; opportunist reasons may be and
are in place elsewhere, not here. Finally we must completely
disavow that maxim of the Middle Ages: "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Philosophia
ancilla Theologiæ</i>," and no less, too, the war-cries
of the university class-rooms with their partisanship of
one or other religious or political party. All fanaticism is
the enemy of science, which must above all things be
<em>independent</em>.</p>

<p>And when we turn from the search for Truth back once
more to therapeutics, we see immediately that here too we
are in agreement. In practice expediency <em>must</em> rule: the
doctor from the yellow region must adapt himself to the sick
in the yellow region, as must the doctor in the blue region,
to his patients; both have the same object in view. And
the doctor who lives in the white light of the sun must take
into consideration the past experiences of his patients from
the yellow or blue region, in spite of, or perhaps rather
because of, his own wider knowledge. In such cases the way
to healing will be long and difficult, may indeed lead more
easily into a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i>, than in cases where he has to do with
patients who, like himself, have already come to a knowledge
of the white sunlight, or, one might say, when his patient-material
has "already sorted itself out." With such sorted-out
material the psychoanalyst can employ psychoanalysis
exclusively; and may deem himself happy in that he need
not "play the augur." Now, what are these psychoanalytic
methods? If I understand you aright, from beginning to
end it is a question of dealing directly and openly with <em>the
basic forces of the human soul</em>, so that the analysed person, be
he sick or sound or in some stage between&mdash;for health and
sickness flow over by imperceptible degrees into one another&mdash;shall
gradually have his eyes opened to the drama that is
being acted within him. He has to come to an understanding
of the development of the hostile automatisms of his personality,
and by means of this understanding he must gradually
learn to free himself from them; he must learn, too, how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
employ and strengthen the favourable automatisms. He must
learn to make his self-knowledge real, and of practical use,
to control his soul's workings so that a balance may be
established between the spheres of emotion and reason. And
what share in all this has the physician's <em>suggestion</em>? I can
scarcely believe that suggestion can be altogether avoided till
the patient feels himself really <em>free</em>. Such freedom, it goes
without saying, is the main thing to strive for, and it must
be <em>active</em>. The sick man who simply obeys a suggestion,
obeys it only just so long as the "transference to the doctor"
remains potent.</p>

<p>But if he wishes to be able to adjust himself to all circumstances
he must have fortified himself "from within." He
should no longer need the crutches of faith, but be capable
of encountering all theoretical and practical problems squarely,
and of solving them by himself. That is surely your view?
Or have I not understood correctly?</p>

<p>I next ask, must not every single case be treated differently,
of course <em>within the limits of the psychoanalytic method</em>? For
if every case is a case by itself, it must indeed demand
individual treatment.</p>

<p>"Il n'y a pas de maladies, il n'y a que des malades," said
a French doctor whose name escapes me. But <em>on broad lines</em>,
what course, from a technical point of view, does analysis
take, and what deviations occur most frequently? That
I would gladly learn from you. I take for granted that all
"augurs' tricks," darkened rooms, masquerading, chloroform,
are out of the question.</p>

<p>Psychoanalysis&mdash;purged so far as is humanly possible from
suggestive influence&mdash;appears to have an essential difference
from Dubois' psychotherapy. With Dubois, from the beginning
conversation about the past is forbidden, and "the moral
reasons for recovery" placed in the forefront; whilst psychoanalysis
uses the subconscious material from the patient's
past as well as present, for present self-understanding.
Another difference lies in the conception of morality: morals
are above all "<em>relative</em>." But what essential forms shall
they assume at those moments when one can hardly avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
suggestion? You will say, the occasion must decide. Agreed,
as regards older people, or adults, who have to live in an
unenlightened <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">milieu</i>. But if one is dealing with children,
the seed of the future, is it not a sacred duty to enlighten
them as to the shaky foundations of the so-called "moral"
conceptions of the past, which have only a dogmatic basis;
is it not a duty to educate them into full freedom by courageously
unveiling Truth? I ask this not so much with
regard to the analysing doctor as to the teacher. May not
the creation of <em>free schools</em> be looked for as one task for the
psychoanalyst?</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p class="center"><em>From Dr. Jung.</em></p>

<p class="center">11th February, 1913.</p>

<p>The idea of the relativity of "Truth" has been current for
ages, but whether true or not, it does not stand in the way of
anything save the beliefs of dogma and authority.</p>

<p>You ask me, or indeed tell me&mdash;what psychoanalysis is.
Before considering your views, permit me first to try and mark
out the territory and definition of psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis
is primarily just a method&mdash;but a method complying
with all the rigorous demands insisted upon to-day by the
conception "method." Let it be made plain at once that
psychoanalysis is not an <em>anamnesis</em>, as those who know
everything without learning are pleased to believe. It is
essentially a method for the exploration of the unconscious
associations, into which no question of the conscious self
enters. Again, it is not a <em>kind</em> of <em>examination</em> of the nature
of an intelligence test, though this mistake is common in
certain circles. It is no <em>cathartic method</em>, abreacting real and
phantastic "traumata," with or without hypnosis. <em>Psychoanalysis
is a method which makes possible the analytic reduction
of the psychic content to its simplest expression, and the discovery
of the line of least resistance in the development of a harmonious
personality.</em> In neurosis, straightforward direction of life's
energies is lacking, because opposing tendencies traverse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
hinder psychological adaptation. Psychoanalysis, so far as
our present knowledge of it goes, thus appears to be simply
a rational nerve-therapy.</p>

<p>For the technical application of psychoanalysis no programme
can be formulated. There are only general principles,
and, for the individual case, working rules. (Here let
me refer you to Freud's work in volume I. of the <cite>Internationale
Zeitschrift für Ärztliche Psychoanalyse</cite>.) My one
working rule is to conduct the analysis as a perfectly
ordinary, sensible conversation, and to avoid all appearance
of medical magic.</p>

<p>The leading principle of the psychoanalytic technique is to
analyse the <em>psychic material which offers itself then and there</em>.
Every interference on the part of the analyst, with the object
of inducing the analysis to follow some systematic course, is
a gross mistake in technique. <em>So-called chance is the law and
the order of psychoanalysis.</em></p>

<p>Naturally in the beginning of the analysis the anamnesis
and the diagnosis come first. The subsequent analytic process
develops quite differently in every case. To give rules
is well-nigh impossible. All one can say is that very frequently,
quite at the beginning, a series of resistances have
to be overcome, resistances against both method and man.
Patients having no idea of psychoanalysis must first be given
some understanding of the method. In those who already
know something of it there are very often many misconceptions
to set right, and frequently one has to deal also with
many reproaches cast by scientific criticism. In either case
the misconceptions rest upon arbitrary interpretations, superficiality,
or complete ignorance of the facts.</p>

<p>If the patient is himself a doctor his special knowledge
may prove extremely tiresome. To intelligent colleagues it
is best to give a complete theoretic exposition. With foolish
and limited persons you begin quietly with analysis. In the
unconscious of such folk there is a confederate that never
refuses help. From the analysis of the very earliest dreams
the emptiness of the criticism is obvious; and ultimately of
the whole beautiful edifice of supposedly scientific scepticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
nothing remains, save a little heap of personal vanity. I have
had amusing experiences here.</p>

<p>It is best to let the patient talk freely and to confine
oneself to pointing out connexions here and there. When the
conscious material is exhausted we come to the dreams, which
furnish us with the subliminal material. If people have no
dreams, as they allege, or if they forget them, there is usually
still some conscious material that ought to be produced and
discussed, but is kept back owing to resistances. When the
conscious is emptied then come the dreams, which are indeed,
as you know, the chief material of the analysis.</p>

<p>How the "Analysis" is to be made and what is to be
said to patients depends, firstly, upon the material to be dealt
with; secondly, on the doctor's skill; and, thirdly, on the
patient's capacity. I must insist that no one ought to undertake
analysis except on the basis of a sound knowledge of
the subject; that necessitates an intimate understanding of the
existing literature. Without this, the work may be bungled.</p>

<p>I do not know what else to tell you beforehand. I must
wait for further questions. In regard to questions of morality
and education let me say that these belong to the later stages
of the analysis, wherein they find&mdash;or should find&mdash;solutions
for themselves. <em>You cannot compile recipes out of psychoanalysis.</em></p>


<hr class="tb" />

<h4>VII</h4>

<p class="center"><em>From Dr. Loÿ.</em></p>

<p class="center">10th February, 1913.</p>

<p>You write that a solid knowledge of the psychoanalytic
literature is necessary for initiation into psychoanalysis.
I should agree, but with a certain reservation: the more one
reads, the more one notices how many contradictions there
are among the different writers, and less and less does one
know&mdash;until one has had sufficient personal experience&mdash;to
which view to give adherence, since quite frequently assertions
are made without any proof. For example, I had thought
(strengthened in the view by my own experience of suggestion-therapy)
that the transference to the doctor might be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
essential condition in the patient's cure. But you write:
"We psychoanalysts do not build upon the patient's faith,
rather do we have to deal with his criticism." And Stekel
writes, on the other hand (<cite>Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse</cite>,
3rd year, vol. IV., p. 176, "Ausgänge der psychoanalytischen
Kuren"): "Love for the doctor can become a power
essential to recovery. Neurotics never get well for love of
themselves. They recover out of love for the doctor. They
give him that pleasure." Here again, surely, stress is laid
on the power of suggestion? And yet Stekel too thinks he is
a psychoanalyst pure and simple. On the other hand, you
say in your letter of Jan. 20th that "the doctor's personality
is one of the main factors in the cure." Should not this
expression be translated: "When the doctor inspires respect
in the patient and is worthy of his love, the patient will
gladly follow his example and endeavour to recover from his
neurosis and fulfil his human duties in the widest sense"? I
think one can only emerge from all this uncertainty by means
of much personal experience, which will indicate also which
way best suits one's own personality and brings the greatest
therapeutic success. This is a further reason for undergoing
analysis oneself, to recognise fully what one is. I was decidedly
in agreement with your definition of psychoanalysis
in its first (negative) portion: psychoanalysis is neither an
<em>anamnesis</em> nor a <em>method of examination</em> after the fashion of
a test for intelligence, nor yet a <em>psychocatharsis</em>. In your
second (positive) part, however, your definition: "Psychoanalysis
is a method of discovering the line of least resistance
to the harmonious development of the whole personality,"
seems to me valid for the patient's inertia, but not for the
releasing of the sublimated libido with a view to the new
direction of life. You consider that the neurosis causes a
lack of singleness of aim in life, because opposing tendencies
hinder psychic adaptation. True, but will not this psychic
adaptation eventuate quite differently according as the patient,
when well, directs his life either to the avoidance of pain
merely (line of least resistance) or to the achievement of
the greatest pleasure?&mdash;In the first case he would be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
passive, he would merely reconcile himself "to the emptiness
of reality" (Stekel, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 187). In the second
he would be "filled with enthusiasm" for something or
other or some person or other. But what will determine
this choice of his as to whether he will be passive rather
than active in his "second life"? In your view, will the
determining factor manifest itself spontaneously in the course
of the analysis, and must the doctor carefully avoid swaying
the balance to one side or other by his influence? Or must
he, if he does <em>not</em> renounce the right to canalise the patient's
libido in some particular direction, renounce the right to be
called a psychoanalyst, and is he to be regarded as "moderate"
or altogether as "wild"?<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> (Cf. Furtmüller, "Wandlungen
in der Freudschen Schule," <cite>Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse</cite>,
vols. IV., V., 3rd year, p. 191.) But I think you have already
answered this question, since in your last letter you write:
"Every interference on the part of the analyst is a gross
mistake in technique. So-called chance is the law and the
order of psychoanalysis." But, torn from its context, perhaps
this does not quite give your whole meaning. With
regard to detailed explanation of the psychoanalytic method
before the beginning of the analysis, I think you agree with
Freud and Stekel: give too little rather than too much. For
the knowledge <em>instilled into</em> a patient remains more or less half-knowledge,
and half-knowledge engenders "the desire to know
better" (than the analyst), which only impedes progress.
So, after brief explanation, first "let the patient talk," then
and there point out connexions, then after the exhaustion of
the conscious material, take dreams.</p>

<p>But there another difficulty confronts me which I have
already pointed out in our talks: you find the patient
adapting himself to the doctor's tone, language, jargon,
whether from conscious imitation, transference, or even
resistance, when he can fight the analyst with his own
weapons; how then can you possibly prevent his beginning
to produce all manner of phantasies as supposedly real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
traumata of early childhood, and <em>dreams</em> supposedly spontaneous
which are in reality, though not designedly, directly
or indirectly <em>suggested</em>? I then told you that Forel ("Der
Hypnotismus") made his patients dream just what he
wanted, and I have myself easily repeated the experiment.
But if the analyst desires to <em>suggest nothing</em>, should he
remain silent for the most part and let the patient speak&mdash;except
that in interpreting dreams he may lay before the
patient his own interpretation?</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<h4>VIII</h4>

<p class="center"><em>From Dr. Jung.</em></p>

<p class="center">18th February, 1913.</p>

<p>I cannot but agree with your observation that confusion
reigns in psychoanalytic literature. Just at this moment
different points of view are developing in the theoretical
conception of the analytic results; not to mention many
individual deviations. Over against Freud's almost purely
<em>causal</em> conception, there has developed, apparently in absolute
contradiction, Adler's purely <em>final</em> view, but in reality
the latter is an essential complement of Freud's theory. I
hold rather to a middle course, taking into account both
standpoints. That discord still reigns round the ultimate
questions of psychoanalysis need not surprise us when
we consider the difficulty. The problem of the therapeutic
effect of psychoanalysis is bound up in particular with
supremely difficult questions, so that it would indeed be
astonishing if we had yet reached final certitude. Stekel's
statement to which you refer is very characteristic. What he
says about love for the doctor is obviously true, but it is
a simple affirmation, and not a goal or plumb-line of the
analytic therapy. If his statement were the goal, many
cures, it is true, would be possible, but also many calamities
might result which are avoidable. But the aim is so to
educate the patient that he will get well for his own sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and by reason of his own determination, rather than to procure
his doctor some sort of advantage; though of course it would
be absurd from the therapeutic standpoint not to allow the
patient to get better because in doing so he does the doctor a
good turn also. It suffices if the patient knows it. But we
must not prescribe for him which path he should take to
recovery. Naturally it seems to me (from the psychoanalytic
standpoint) an inadmissible use of suggestive influence
if the patient is compelled to get better out of love for
the doctor. And indeed such compulsion may sometimes take
bitter revenge. The "you must and shall be saved" is no
more to be commended in nerve-therapy than in any other
department of life. It contradicts the principle of analytic
treatment, which shuns all coercion and desires to let everything
grow up from within. I do not, as you know, object to
influencing by use of suggestion in general, but merely to a
doubtful motivation. If the doctor demands that his patient
shall get well from love of himself, the patient may easily
reckon on reciprocal services and will without doubt try to
extort them. I can but utter a warning against any such
method. A far stronger motive for recovery&mdash;also a far
healthier and ethically more valuable one&mdash;consists in the
patient's thorough insight into the real state of affairs, the
recognition of how things are now and how they ought to be.
The man of any sort of worth will then discern that he can
hardly sit down at ease in the quagmire of his neurosis.</p>

<p>With your rendering of what I said about the healing
power of personality I cannot entirely agree. I wrote that
the doctor's personality has a power for healing because the
patient reads the doctor's personality: not that he produces
a cure through <em>love</em> of the doctor. The doctor cannot prevent
the patient's beginning to behave himself towards <em>his</em> conflicts
just as the doctor himself behaves, for nothing is finer
than a neurotic's intuition. <em>But every strong transference
serves this same purpose.</em> If the doctor makes himself charming,
he buys off from the patient a series of resistances which
he should have overcome, and whose overcoming will certainly
have to be gone through later on. Nothing is won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
by this technique; at most the beginning of the analysis
is made easy for the patient (though this is not quite without
its use in certain cases). To be able to crawl through a
barbed wire fence without some enticing end in view testifies
to an ascetic strength of will which you can expect neither
from the ordinary person nor from the neurotic. Even the
Christian religion, whose moral demands certainly reached
a great height, thought it no scorn to represent the near
approach of the Kingdom of Heaven as goal and reward of
earthly pain. In my view, the doctor may well speak of the
rewards which follow the toils of analysis. But he must not
depict himself or his friendship, in hints or promises, as reward,
if he is not seriously determined to keep his word.</p>

<p>In regard to your criticism of my outline-definition of the
conception of psychoanalysis, it must be observed that the
road over the steep mountain is the line of least resistance
only when a ferocious bull waits for you in the pleasant
valley-road. In other words, the line of least resistance is a
compromise with <em>all</em> demands, and not with inertia alone.
It is prejudice to think that the line of least resistance
coincides with the path of inertia. (That's what we thought
in the days when we dawdled over Latin exercises.) Inertia
is only an immediate advantage and leads to consequences
which produce the worst resistances; as a whole, it does not
lie in the direction of least resistance. Life along the line
of least resistance is not synonymous with a man's regardless
pursuit of his own egoistic desires. He who lives thus
soon painfully perceives that he is not moving along the
line of least resistance, for he is also a social being, and
not merely a bundle of egoistic instincts, as some people
rather like to depict him. This is best seen among primitive
men and herd-animals, who all have a richly developed social
sense. Without it, indeed, the herd could not exist at all.
Man as herd-animal has therefore by no manner of means to
subject himself to laws enforced on him from without; he
carries his social imperatives within himself, <em>a priori</em>, as an
inborn necessity. As you see, I here put myself in decided
opposition to certain views&mdash;I think quite unjustified&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
have been put forth here and there inside the psychoanalytic
movement.</p>

<p>So the line of least resistance does not signify <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">eo ipso</i>
the avoidance of unpleasure so much as the just balancing
of unpleasure and pleasure. Painful activity by itself leads
to no result but exhaustion. Man must be able to take
pleasure in his life, or the struggle of life has no reward.
What direction the patient's future life should take is not
ours to judge. We must not imagine we know better
than his own nature&mdash;or we prove ourselves educators of
the worst kind. Psychoanalysis is but a means of removing
stones from the path, and in no way a method (as hypnotism
often pretends to be) of putting anything into the patient
which was not there before. So we renounce any attempt
to give a direction, and occupy ourselves only with setting
in proper relief all that analysis brings into the light of
day, in order that the patient may see clearly, and be
in a position to draw the appropriate conclusions. Anything
that he has not himself won, he does not in the long
run believe in; and all that he has received from authority
keeps him still infantile. He must rather be put in such
a position as will enable him to take control of his own
life. It is the art of the psychoanalyst to follow the
patient's apparently mistaken paths without prejudice, and
thus to discover his strayed and separated sheep. Working
on a system, according to a preconceived scheme, we spoil
the best results of the analysis. So I hold fast to the
maxim you quote from me: "Every interference on the
part of the analyst is a gross mistake in technique. So-called
chance is the law and the order of psychoanalysis."</p>

<p>You surely recognise that the schoolmaster-view never
releases us from the attempt to correct Nature and the desire
to force upon her our limited "truths." In nerve-therapy
we get so many wonderful experiences&mdash;unforeseen and impossible
to foresee&mdash;that surely we ought to dismiss all hope
of being infallibly able to point out the right path. The
roundabout way and even the wrong way are necessary. If
you deny this you must also deny that the errors in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
history of the whole world have been necessary. That indeed
were a world-conception fit for a schoolmaster. For psychoanalysis
this view suits not at all.</p>

<p>The question as to how much the analyst involuntarily
suggests to the patient is a very ticklish one. Undoubtedly
that has a much more important place than psychoanalysts
have till now admitted. Experience has convinced us that
the patient rapidly avails himself of the ideas won through
the analysis, and of whatever comes to light through
the shaping of the dreams. You may obtain all manner
of such impressions from Stekel's book: "Die Sprache
des Traumes" ("The Language of the Dream"). I had
once a most instructive experience: a very intelligent lady
had from the beginning extreme transference phantasies
which appeared in well-recognised erotic forms. Nevertheless
she entirely declined to admit their existence. Of course
she was betrayed by the dreams in which my own person
was hidden behind some other figure, and often difficult
to unveil. A long series of such dreams forced me at
last to say: "So you see it is always like that, and the
person of whom one has really dreamt is replaced and
hidden by some one else in the manifest dream." Till then
the patient had obstinately contested this point. But this
time she could no longer evade it, and had to admit my
rule&mdash;but only that she might play me a trick. Next day
she brought me a dream in which she and I appeared in
a manifest lascivious situation. I was naturally perplexed
and thought of my rule. Her first association to the dream
was the malicious question: "It's always true, isn't it, that
the person of whom one is really dreaming is replaced by
some one else in the manifest dream-content?"</p>

<p>Clearly, she had made use of her experience to find a
protective formula by means of which she secured the open
expression of her phantasies in an apparently innocent way.</p>

<p>This example aptly shows how patients avail themselves
of insight gained during analysis; they use it symbolically.
You get caught in your own net if you give credence to
the idea of unalterable, permanent symbols. That has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
already happened to more than one psychoanalyst. It
is therefore fallacious to try to prove any particular theory
from the dreams arising in the course of analysis. For this
purpose the only conclusive dreams are those derived from
demonstrably uninfluenced persons. In such cases one
would only have to exclude the possibility of telepathic
thought-reading. But if you concede this possibility you
will have to subject very many things to a rigorous re-examination
and, among others, many judicial verdicts.</p>

<p>But although we must do full justice to the force of
suggestion, we must not overrate it. The patient is no
empty sack into which you may stuff whatever you like;
on the contrary, he brings his own predetermined contents
which strive obstinately against suggestion and always obtrude
themselves afresh. Through analytic "suggestions,"
only the outward <em>form</em> is determined, never the content&mdash;this
is always being freshly impressed upon my notice. The
form is the unlimited, the ever-changing; but the content is
fixed, and only to be assailed slowly and with great difficulty.
Were it not so, suggestion-therapy would be in every respect
the most effective, profitable, and easiest therapy,&mdash;a real
panacea. That, alas! it is not, as every honourable hypnotist
will freely admit.</p>

<p>To return to your question as to how far it is conceivable
that patients may deceive the doctor by making use&mdash;perhaps
involuntarily&mdash;of his expressions: this is indeed
a very serious problem. The analyst must exercise all possible
care and practise unsparing self-criticism if he would
avoid, as far as possible, being led into error by patients'
dreams. It may be admitted that they almost always use
modes of expression in their dreams learnt in analysis&mdash;some
more, some less. Interpretations of earlier symbols
will themselves be used again as fresh symbols in later dreams.
It happens not seldom, for instance, that sexual situations
which appear in symbolic form in the earlier dreams, will
appear "undisguised" in later ones, and here again they
are the symbolic expression of ideas of another character
capable of further analysis. The not infrequent dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of incestuous cohabitation is by no means an "undisguised"
content, but a dream as freshly symbolic and capable of
analysis as all others. You surely only reach the paradoxical
view that such a dream is "undisguised" if you are pledged
to the sexual theory of neurosis.</p>

<p>That the patient may mislead the doctor for a longer
or shorter time by means of deliberate deception and misrepresentation
is possible; just as occasionally happens in all
other departments of medicine. Therewith the patient injures
himself most, since he has to pay for every deception or
suppression, with aggravated or additional symptoms. Deceptions
are so obviously disadvantageous to himself that
in the end he can scarcely avoid the definite relinquishment
of such a course.</p>

<p>The technique of analysis we can best postpone for oral
discussion.</p>

<p class="center"><em>From Dr. Loÿ.</em></p>

<p class="center">23rd February, 1913.</p>

<p>From your letter of 16th February I want first to single out
the end, where you so admirably assign to its proper place
the power of suggestion in psychoanalysis: "The patient is
no empty sack, into which you can cram what you will; he
brings his own predetermined content with him, with which
one has always to reckon afresh." With this I fully agree,
my own experience confirms it. And you add: "This content
remains untouched by involuntary analytical suggestion, but
its form is altered, proteus-fashion, beyond measure." So
it becomes a matter of a sort of "mimicry" by which the
patient seeks to escape the analyst, who is driving him into a
corner and therefore for the moment seems to him an enemy.
Until at last, through the joint work of patient and analyst&mdash;the
former spontaneously yielding up his psychic content,
the latter only interpreting and explaining&mdash;the analysis
succeeds in bringing so much light into the darkness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
patient's psyche that he can see the true relationships and,
without any preconceived plan of the analyst's, can himself
draw the right conclusions and apply them to his future life.
This new life will betake itself along the line of least resistance&mdash;or
should we not rather say, the least resistances, as
a "compromise with all the necessities," in a just balancing
of pleasure and unpleasure? It is not we who must arbitrarily
seek to determine how matters stand for the patient and
what will benefit him; his own nature decides. In other words,
we must assume the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> of the accoucheur who can bring
out into the light of day a child already alive, but who must
avoid a series of mistakes if the child is to remain able to live
and the mother is not to be injured. All this is very clear to
me, since it is only the application to the psychoanalytic
method of a general principle which should have universal
validity: never do violence to Nature. Hence I also see
that the psychoanalyst must follow his patient's apparently
"wrong roads" if the patient is ever to arrive at his
own convictions and be freed once and for all from infantile
reliance on authority. We ourselves as individuals have learnt
or can only learn by making mistakes how to avoid them
for the future, and mankind as a whole has created the
conditions of its present and future stages of development
quite as much by frequent travel along wrong paths as along
the right road. Have not many neurotics&mdash;I do not know if
you will agree, but I think so&mdash;become ill partly for the very
reason that their infantile faith in authority has fallen to
pieces? Now they stand before the wreckage of their faith,
weeping over it, in dire distress because they cannot find a
substitute which shall show them clearly whither their life's
course should now turn. So they remain stuck fast betwixt
infancy which they must unwillingly renounce, and the
serious duties of the present and future (the moral conflict).
I see, particularly in such cases, you are right in saying
it is a mistake to seek to replace the lost faith in
authority by another similar faith, certain to be useful only
so long as the belief lasts. This applies to the deliberate
use of suggestion in psychoanalysis, and the building upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the transference to the doctor as the object of the analytic
therapy. I am no longer in doubt about your maxim:
"Every interference on the analyst's part is a gross mistake
in technique. So-called chance is the law and the order of
psychoanalysis." Further, I am entirely in agreement with
you when you say that <em>altruism necessarily must be innate in
man considered as a herd-animal</em>. The contrary would be the
thing to be wondered at.</p>

<p>I should be much disposed to agree that not the egoistic,
but the altruistic instincts are primary. Love and trust
of the child for the mother who feeds it, nurses, cherishes
and pets it,&mdash;love of the man for his wife, regarded as the
going out towards another's personality,&mdash;love for offspring,
care for it,&mdash;love for kinsfolk, etc. The egoistic instincts
owe their origin to the desire for exclusive possession of all
that surrounds love, the desire to possess the mother exclusively,
in opposition to the father and the brothers and
sisters, the desire to have a woman for himself alone, the
desire to possess exclusively ornaments, clothing, etc. But
perhaps you will say I am paradoxical and that the instincts,
egoistic or altruistic, arise together in the heart of man, and
that every instinct is ambivalent in nature. But I have to
ask if the feelings and instincts are really ambivalent? Are
they exactly bipolar? Are the qualities of all emotions
altogether comparable? Is love really the opposite of hate?</p>

<p>However that may be, in any case it is well that man
bears the social law within himself, as an inborn imperative;
otherwise our civilised humanity would fare badly, having to
subject themselves to laws imposed on them from outside
only: they would be impervious to the inheritance of the
earlier religious faiths, and would soon fall into complete
anarchy. Man would then have to ask himself whether it
would not be better to maintain by force an extreme belief in
religious authority such as prevailed in the Middle Ages. For
the benefits of civilisation, which strove to grant every individual
as much outward freedom as was consistent with the
freedom of others, would be well worth the sacrifice of free
research. But the age of this use of force against nature is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
past, civilised man has left this wrong track behind, not
arbitrarily, but obeying an inner necessity, and we may look
joyfully towards the future. Mankind, advancing in knowledge,
will find its way across the ruins of faith in authority
to the moral autonomy of the individual.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<h4>X</h4>

<p class="center"><em>From Dr. Jung.</em></p>

<p class="center">March, 1913.</p>

<p>At various places in your letters it has struck me that
the problem of "transference" seems to you particularly
critical. Your feeling is entirely justified. The transference
is indeed at present the central problem of analysis.</p>

<p>You know that Freud regards the transference as the
projection of infantile phantasies upon the doctor. To this
extent the transference is an infantile-erotic relationship.
All the same, viewed from the outside, superficially, the
thing by no means always looks like an infantile-erotic
situation. As long as it is a question of the so-called
"positive" transference, the infantile-erotic character can
usually be recognised without difficulty. But if it is a
"negative" transference, you can see nothing but violent
resistances which sometimes veil themselves in seemingly
critical or sceptical dress. In a certain sense the determining
factor in such circumstances is the patient's relation
to authority, that is, in the last resort, to the father. In
both forms of transference the doctor is treated as if he
were the father&mdash;according to the situation either tenderly
or with hostility. In this view the transference has the
force of a resistance as soon as it becomes a question of
resolving the infantile attitude. But this form of transference
must be destroyed, inasmuch as the object of
analysis is the patient's moral autonomy. A lofty aim, you
will say. Indeed lofty, and far off, but still not altogether
so remote, since it actually corresponds to one of the predominating
tendencies of our stage of civilisation, namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
that urge towards individualisation by which our whole
epoch deserves to be characterised. (Cf. Müller-Lyer: "Die
Familie.") If a man does not believe in this orientation
and still bows before the scientific causal view-point, he will,
of course, be disposed merely to resolve this hostility, and to
let the patient remain in a positive relationship towards the
father, <em>thus expressing the ideal of an earlier epoch of civilisation</em>.
It is commonly recognised that the Catholic Church
represents one of the most powerful organisations based upon
this earlier tendency. I cannot venture to doubt that there
are very many individuals who feel happier under compulsion
from others than when forced to discipline themselves.
(Cf. Shaw: "Man and Superman.") None the less,
we do our neurotic patients a grievous wrong if we try to force
them all into the category of the unfree. Among neurotics,
there are not a few who do not require any reminders of
their social duties and obligations; rather are they born or
destined to become the bearers of new social ideals. They
are neurotic so long as they bow down to authority and
refuse the freedom to which they are destined. Whilst we
look at life only retrospectively, as is the case in the Viennese
psychoanalytic writings, we shall never do justice to this
type of case and never bring the longed-for deliverance. For
in that fashion we can only educate them to become obedient
children, and thereby strengthen the very forces that have
made them ill&mdash;their conservative retardation and their submissiveness
to authority. Up to a certain point this is the
right way to take with the infantile resistance which cannot
<em>yet</em> reconcile itself with authority. But the power which
edged them out from their retrograde dependence on the
father is not at all a childish desire for insubordination, but
the powerful urge towards the development of an individual
personality, and this struggle is their imperative life's task.
Adler's psychology does much greater justice to this situation
than Freud's.</p>

<p>In the one case (that of infantile intractability) the positive
transference signifies a highly important achievement,
heralding cure; in the other (infantile submissiveness) it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
portends a dangerous backsliding, a convenient evasion of
life's duty. The negative transference represents in the first
case an increased resistance, thus a backsliding and an
evasion of duty, but in the second it is an advance of healing
significance. (For the two types, cf. Adler's "Trotz und
Gehorsam.")</p>

<p>The transference then is, as you see, to be judged quite
differently in different cases.</p>

<p>The psychological process of "transference"&mdash;be it negative
or positive&mdash;consists in the libido <em>entrenching itself</em>, as
it were, round the personality of the doctor, the doctor
accordingly representing certain emotional values. (As you
know, by <em>libido</em> I understand very much what Antiquity
meant by the cosmogenic principle of <em>Eros</em>; in modern terminology
simply "psychic energy.") The patient is bound to
the doctor, be it in affection, be it in opposition, and cannot
fail to follow and imitate the doctor's psychic adaptations.
To this he finds himself urgently compelled. And with the
best will in the world and all technical skill, the doctor cannot
prevent him, for intuition works surely and instinctively,
in despite of the conscious judgment, be it never so strong.
Were the doctor himself neurotic, and inadequate in response
to the demands of the external life, or inharmonious within,
the patient would copy the defect and build it up into the
fabric of his own presentations: you may imagine the result.</p>

<p>Accordingly I cannot regard the transference as merely
the transference of infantile-erotic phantasies; no doubt that
is what it is from one standpoint, but I see also in it, as I
said in an earlier letter, the process of the <em>growth of feeling</em>
and <em>adaptation</em>. From this standpoint the infantile erotic
phantasies, in spite of their indisputable reality, appear
rather as material for comparison or as analogous pictures
of something not understood as yet, than as independent
desires. This seems to me the real reason of their being
unconscious. The patient, not knowing the right attitude,
tries to grasp at a right relationship to the doctor by way of
comparison and analogy with his infantile experiences. It is
not surprising that he gropes back for just the most intimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
relations of his childhood, to discover the appropriate formula
for his attitude to the doctor, for this relationship also is
very intimate, and to some extent different from the sexual
relationship, just as is that of the child towards its parents.
This relationship&mdash;child to parent&mdash;which Christianity has
everywhere set up as the symbolic formula for human relationships,
provides a way of restoring to the patient that
directness of ordinary human emotion of which he had been
deprived through the inroad of sexual and social values (from
the standpoint of power, etc.). The purely sexual, more or
less primitive and barbaric valuation, operates in far-reaching
ways against a direct, simple human relationship, and thereupon
a blocking of the libido occurs which easily gives rise
to neurotic formations. By means of analysis of the infantile
portion of the transference-phantasies, the patient is brought
back to the remembrance of his childhood's relationship, and
this&mdash;stripped of its infantile qualities&mdash;gives him a beautiful,
clear picture of direct human intercourse as opposed to the
purely sexual valuation. I cannot regard it as other than a
misconception to judge the childish relationship retrospectively
and therefore as exclusively a sexual one, even though
a certain sexual content can in no wise be denied to it.</p>

<p>Recapitulating, let me say this much of the positive transference:&mdash;</p>

<p>The patient's libido fastens upon the person of the doctor,
taking the shape of expectation, hope, interest, trust, friendship
and love. Then the transference produces the projection
upon the doctor of infantile phantasies, often of predominatingly
erotic tinge. At this stage the transference is
usually of a decidedly sexual character, in spite of the sexual
component remaining relatively unconscious. But this phase
of feeling serves the higher aspect of the growth of human
feeling as a bridge, whereby the patient becomes conscious of
the defectiveness of his own adaptation, through his recognition
of the doctor's attitude, which is accepted as one
suitable to life's demands, and normal in its human relationships.
By help of the analysis, and the recalling of his
childish relationships, the road is seen which leads right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
out of those exclusively sexual or "power" evaluations of
social surroundings which were acquired in puberty and
strongly reinforced by social prejudices. This road leads on
towards a purely human relation and intimacy, not derived
solely from the existence of a sexual or power-relation, but
depending much more upon a regard for personality. That
is the road to freedom which the doctor must show his
patient.</p>

<p>Here indeed I must not omit to say that the obstinate
clinging to the sexual valuation would not be maintained
so tenaciously if it had not also a very deep significance
for that period of life in which propagation is of primary
importance. The discovery of the value of human personality
belongs to a riper age. For young people the search for the
valuable personality is very often merely a cloak for the
evasion of their biological duty. On the other hand, an
older person's exaggerated looking back towards the sexual
valuation of youth, is an undiscerning and often cowardly
and convenient retreat from a duty which demands the
recognition of personal values and his own enrolment among
the ranks of the priesthood of a newer civilisation. The
young neurotic shrinks back in terror from the extension of
his tasks in life, the old from the dwindling and shrinking
of the treasures he has attained.</p>

<p>This conception of the transference is, you will have
noted, most intimately connected with the acceptance of the
idea of biological "<em>duties</em>." By this term you must understand
those tendencies or motives in human beings giving
rise to civilisation, as inevitably as in the bird they give rise
to the exquisitely woven nest, and in the stag to the production
of antlers. The purely causal, not to say materialistic
conception of the immediately preceding decades, would conceive
the organic formation as the reaction of living matter,
and this doubtless provides a position heuristically useful,
but, as far as any real understanding goes, leads only to a
more or less ingenious and <em>apparent</em> reduction and postponement
of the problem. Let me refer you to Bergson's
excellent criticism of this conception. From external forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
but half the result, at most, could ensue; the other half lies
within the individual disposition of the living material,
without which it is obvious the specific reaction-formation
could never be achieved. This principle must be applied
also in psychology. The psyche does not only <em>react</em>; it also
gives its own individual reply to the influences at work upon
it, and at least half the resulting configuration and its existing
disposition is due to this. Civilisation is never, and again
never, to be regarded as merely reaction to environment.
That shallow explanation we may abandon peacefully to the
past century. It is just these very dispositions which we
must regard as imperative in the psychological sphere; it
is easy to get convincing proof daily of their compulsive
power. What I call "biological duty" is identical with these
dispositions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must deal with a matter which seems
to have caused you uneasiness, namely, the <em>moral</em> question.
Among our patients we see many so-called immoral tendencies,
therefore the thought involuntarily forces itself upon
the psychotherapist as to how things would go if all these
desires were to be gratified. You will have discerned already
from my earlier letters that these desires must not be
estimated too literally. As a rule it is rather a matter of
unmeasured and exaggerated demands, arising out of the
patient's stored-up libido, which have usurped a prominent
position, usually quite against his own wish. In most cases
the canalisation of the libido for the fulfilment of life's
simple duties, suffices to reduce these exaggerated desires
to zero. But in some cases it must be recognised that such
"immoral" tendencies are in no way removed by analysis;
on the contrary, they appear more often and more clearly,
hence it becomes plain that they belong to the individual's
biological duties. And this is particularly true of certain
sexual claims, whose aim is an individual valuation of
sexuality. This is not a question for pathology, it is a
social question of to-day which peremptorily demands an
ethical solution. For many it is a biological duty to work
for the solution of this question, to discover some sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
practical solution. (Nature, it is well known, does not content
herself with theories.) To-day we have no real sexual
morality, only a legal attitude towards sexuality; just as the
early Middle Ages had no genuine morality for financial
transactions, but only prejudices and a legal standpoint. We
are not yet sufficiently advanced in the domain of free sexual
activity to distinguish between a moral and an immoral
relationship. We have a clear expression of this in the
customary treatment, or rather ill-treatment, of unmarried
motherhood. For a great deal of sickening hypocrisy, for
the high tide of prostitution, and for the prevalence of sexual
diseases, we may thank both our barbarous, undifferentiated
legal judgments about the sexual situation, and our inability
to develop a finer moral perception of the immense psychologic
differences that may exist in free sexual activity.</p>

<p>This reference to the existence of an exceedingly complicated
and significant problem may suffice to explain why
we by no means seldom meet with individuals among our
patients who are quite specially called, because of their
spiritual and social gifts, to take an active part in the work
of civilisation&mdash;for this they are biologically destined. We
must never forget that what to-day is deemed a moral law
will to-morrow be cast into the melting-pot and transformed,
so that in the near or distant future it may serve as the
basis of a new ethical structure. This much we ought to
have learnt from the history of civilisation, that the forms
of morality belong to the category of transitory things.
The finest psychological tact is required with these critical
natures, so that the dangerous corners of infantile irresponsibility,
indolence and uncontrolledness may be turned, and
a pure, untroubled vision of the possibility of a moral
autonomous activity made possible. Five per cent. on
money lent is fair interest, twenty per cent. is despicable
usury. That point of view we have to apply equally to
the sexual situation.</p>

<p>So it comes about that there are many neurotics whose
innermost delicacy of feeling prevents their being at one
with present-day morality, and they cannot adapt themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
to civilisation as long as their moral code has gaps in
it, the filling up of which is a crying need of the age.
We deceive ourselves greatly if we suppose that many
married women are neurotic only because they are unsatisfied
sexually or because they have not found the right
man, or because they still have a fixation to their infantile
sexuality. The real ground of the neurosis is, in many
cases, the inability to recognise the work that is waiting
for them, of helping to build up a new civilisation. We
are all far too much at the standpoint of the "nothing-but"
psychology; we persist in thinking we can squeeze
the new future which is pressing in at the door into the
framework of the old and the known. And thus the view is
only of the present, never of the future. But it was of most
profound psychological significance when Christianity first
discovered, in the orientation towards the future, a redeeming
principle for mankind. In the past nothing can be
altered, and in the present little, but the future is ours and
capable of raising life's intensity to its highest pitch. A
little space of youth belongs to us, all the rest of life
belongs to our children.</p>

<p>Thus does your question as to the significance of the
loss of faith in authority answer itself. The neurotic is ill
not because he has lost his old faith, but because he has not
yet found a new form for his finest aspirations.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="p3">ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS
IN PSYCHOPATHOLOGY<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>


<p>When we speak of a thing as being "unconscious" we must
not forget that from the point of view of the functioning of
the brain a thing may be unconscious to us in two ways&mdash;physiologically
or psychologically. I shall only deal with
the subject from the latter point of view. So that for our
purposes we may define the unconscious as "the sum of all
those psychological events which are not apperceived, and so
are unconscious."</p>

<p>The unconscious contains all those psychic events which,
because of the lack of the necessary intensity of their functioning,
are unable to pass the threshold which divides the
conscious from the unconscious; so that they remain in
effect below the surface of the conscious, and flit by in
subliminal phantom forms.</p>

<p>It has been known to psychologists since the time of
Leibniz that the elements&mdash;that is to say, the ideas and
feelings which go to make up the conscious mind, the so-called
conscious content&mdash;are of a complex nature, and rest
upon far simpler and altogether unconscious elements; it is
the combination of these which gives the element of consciousness.
Leibniz has already mentioned the <em>perceptions insensibles</em>&mdash;those
vague perceptions which Kant called "shadowy"
representations, which could only attain to consciousness in
an indirect manner. Later philosophers assigned the first
place to the unconscious, as the foundation upon which the
conscious was built.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>But this is not the place to consider the many speculative
theories nor the endless philosophical discussions concerning
the nature and quality of the unconscious. We must be
satisfied with the definition already given, which will prove
quite sufficient for our purpose, namely the conception of the
unconscious as the sum of all psychical processes below the
threshold of consciousness.</p>

<p>The question of the importance of the unconscious for
psychopathology may be briefly put as follows: "In what
manner may we expect to find unconscious psychic material
behave in cases of psychosis and neurosis?"</p>

<p>In order to get a better grasp of the situation in connexion
with mental disorders, we may profitably consider
first how unconscious psychic material behaves in the case
of normal people, especially trying to visualize what in normal
men is apt to be unconscious. As a preliminary to this
knowledge we must get a complete understanding of what is
contained in the conscious mind; and then, by a process of
elimination we may expect to find what is contained in the
unconscious, for obviously&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per exclusionem</i>&mdash;what is in the
conscious cannot be unconscious. For this purpose we
examine all activities, interests, passions, cares, and joys,
which are conscious to the individual. All that we are thus
able to discover becomes, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipso facto</i>, of no further moment as
a content of the unconscious, and we may then expect to find
only those things contained in the unconscious which we have
not found in the conscious mind.</p>

<p>Let us take a concrete example: A merchant, who is
happily married, father of two children, thorough and painstaking
in his business affairs, and at the same time trying in
a reasonable degree to improve his position in the world,
carries himself with self-respect, is enlightened in religious
matters, and even belongs to a society for the discussion of
liberal ideas.</p>

<p>What can we reasonably consider to be the content of the
unconscious in the case of such an individual?</p>

<p>Considered from the above theoretical standpoint, everything
in the personality that is not contained in the conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
mind should be found in the unconscious. Let us agree,
then, that this man consciously considers himself to possess
all the fine attributes we have just described&mdash;no more, no
less. Then it must obviously result that he is entirely
unaware that a man may be not merely industrious, thorough,
and painstaking, but that he may also be careless, indifferent,
untrustworthy; for some of these last attributes are the
common heritage of mankind and may be found to be
an essential component of every character. This worthy
merchant forgets that quite recently he allowed several letters
to remain unanswered which he could easily have answered
at once. He forgets, too, that he failed to bring a book
home which his wife has asked him to get at the book-stall,
where she had previously ordered it, although he might
easily have made a note of her wish. But such occurrences
are common with him. Therefore we are obliged to conclude
that he is also lazy and untrustworthy. He is convinced
that he is a thoroughly loyal subject; but for all that he
failed to declare the whole of his income to the assessor, and
when they raise his taxes, he votes for the Socialists.</p>

<p>He believes himself to be an independent thinker, yet a
little while back he undertook a big deal on the Stock Exchange,
and when he came to enter the details of the transaction
in his books he noticed with considerable misgivings
that it fell upon a Friday, the 13th of the month. Therefore,
he is also superstitious and not free in his thinking.</p>

<p>So here we are not at all surprised to find these compensating
vices to be an essential content of the unconscious.
Obviously, therefore, the reverse is true&mdash;namely,
that unconscious virtues compensate for conscious deficiencies.
The law which ought to follow as the result of
such deductions would appear to be quite simple&mdash;to wit,
the conscious spendthrift is unconsciously a miser; the
philanthropist is unconsciously an egoist and misanthrope.
But, unfortunately, it is not quite so easy as that, although
there is a basis of truth in this simple rule. For there are
essential hereditary dispositions of a latent or manifest
nature which upset the simple rule of compensation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
which vary greatly in individual cases. From entirely
different motives a man may, for instance, be a philanthropist,
but the manner of his philanthropy depends upon
his originally inherited disposition, and the way in which the
philanthropic attitude is compensated depends upon his
motives. It is not sufficient simply to know that a certain
person is philanthropic in order to diagnose an unconscious
egoism. For we must also bring to such a diagnosis a careful
study of the motives involved.</p>

<p>In the case of normal people the principal function of the
unconscious is to effect a compensation and thus produce a
balance. All extreme conscious tendencies are softened and
toned down through an effective opposite impulse in the unconscious.
This compensating agency, as I have tried to
show in the case of the merchant, maintains itself through
certain unconscious, inconsequent activities, as it were, which
Freud has very well described as symptomatic acts (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Symptom-handlungen</i>).</p>

<p>To Freud we owe thanks also for having called attention
to the importance of dreams, for by means of them, also, we
are able to learn much about this compensating function.
There is a fine historical example of this in the well-known
dream of Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth chapter of
the Book of Daniel, where Nebuchadnezzar at the height
of his power had a dream which foretold his downfall. He
dreamed of a tree which had raised its head even up to
heaven and now must be hewn down. This is a dream
which is obviously a counterpoise to the exaggerated feeling
of royal power.</p>

<p>Now considering states in which the mental balance is
disturbed, we can easily see, from what has preceded, wherein
lies the importance of the unconscious for psychopathology.
Let us ponder the question of where and in what manner
the unconscious manifests itself in abnormal mental conditions.
The way in which the unconscious works is most
clearly seen in disturbances of a psychogenic nature, such as
hysteria, compulsion neurosis, etc.</p>

<p>We have known for a long time that certain symptoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
of these disturbances are produced by unconscious psychic
events. Just as clear, but less recognised, are the manifestations
of the unconscious in actually insane patients.
As the intuitive ideas of normal men do not spring from
logical combinations of the conscious mind, so the hallucinations
and delusions of the insane arise, not out of conscious
but out of unconscious processes.</p>

<p>Formerly, when we held a more materialistic view of
psychiatry we were inclined to believe that all delusions, hallucinations,
stereotypic acts, etc., were provoked by morbid
processes in the brain cells. Such a theory, however, ignores
that delusions, hallucinations, etc., are also to be met with in
certain functional disturbances, and not only in the case of
functional disturbances, but also in the case of normal people.
Primitive people may have visions and hear strange voices
without having their mental processes at all disturbed. To
seek to ascribe symptoms of that nature directly to a disease
of the brain cells I hold to be superficial and unwarranted.
Hallucinations show very plainly how a part of the unconscious
content can force itself across the threshold of the
conscious. The same is true of a delusion whose appearance
is at once strange and unexpected by the patient.</p>

<p>The expression "mental balance" is no mere figure of
speech, for its disturbance is a real disturbance of that equilibrium
which actually exists between the unconscious and
conscious content to a greater extent than has heretofore
been recognised or understood. As a matter of fact, it amounts
to this&mdash;that the normal functioning of the unconscious
processes breaks through into the conscious mind in an
abnormal manner, and thereby disturbs the adaptation of
the individual to his environment.</p>

<p>If we study attentively the history of any such person
coming under our observation, we shall often find that he has
been living for a considerable time in a sort of peculiar
individual isolation, more or less shut off from the world
of reality. This constrained condition of aloofness may be
traced back to certain innate or early acquired peculiarities,
which show themselves in the events of his life. For instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
in the histories of those suffering from dementia præcox we
often hear such a remark as this: "He was always of a
pensive disposition, and much shut up in himself. After his
mother died he cut himself off still more from the world,
shunning his friends and acquaintances." Or again, we may
hear, "Even as a child he devised many peculiar inventions;
and later, when he became an engineer, he occupied himself
with most ambitious schemes."</p>

<p>Without discussing the matter further it must be plain
that a counterpoise is produced in the unconscious as a
compensation to the one-sidedness of the conscious attitude.
In the first case we may expect to find an increasing
pressing forward in the unconscious, of a wish for human
intercourse, a longing for mother, friends, relatives; while
in the second case self-criticism will try to establish a correcting
balance. Among normal people a condition never
arises so one-sided that the natural corrective tendencies of
the unconscious entirely lose their value in the affairs of
everyday life; but in the case of abnormal people, it is
eminently characteristic that the individual entirely fails to
recognise the compensating influences which arise in the
unconscious. He even continues to accentuate his one-sidedness;
this is in accord with the well-known psychological
fact that the worst enemy of the wolf is the wolf-hound,
the greatest despiser of the negro is the mulatto, and that
the biggest fanatic is the convert; for I should be a fanatic
were I to attack a thing outwardly which inwardly I am
obliged to concede as right.</p>

<p>The mentally unbalanced man tries to defend himself
against his own unconscious, that is to say, he battles against
his own compensating influences. The man already dwelling
in a sort of atmosphere of isolation, continues to remove himself
further and further from the world of reality, and the
ambitious engineer strives by increasingly morbid exaggerations
of invention to disprove the correctness of his own compensating
powers of self-criticism. As a result of this a
condition of excitation is produced, from which results a
great lack of harmony between the conscious and unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
attitudes. The pairs of opposites are torn asunder, the resulting
division or strife leads to disaster, for the unconscious soon
begins to intrude itself violently upon the conscious processes.
Then odd and peculiar thoughts and moods supervene, and
not infrequently incipient forms of hallucination, which
clearly bear the stamp of the internal conflict.</p>

<p>These corrective impulses or compensations which now
break through into the conscious mind, should theoretically
be the beginning of the healing process, because through
them the previously isolated attitude should apparently
be relieved. But in reality this does not result, for the
reason that the unconscious corrective impulses which thus
succeed in making themselves apparent to the conscious
mind, do so in a form that is altogether unacceptable to
consciousness.</p>

<p>The isolated individual begins to hear strange voices, which
accuse him of murder and all sorts of crimes. These voices
drive him to desperation and in the resulting agitation he
attempts to get into contact with the surrounding <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">milieu</i>, and
does what he formerly had anxiously avoided. The compensation,
to be sure, is reached, but to the detriment of the
individual.</p>

<p>The pathological inventor, who is unable to profit by his
previous failures, by refusing to recognise the value of his
own self-criticism, becomes the creator of still more preposterous
designs. He wishes to accomplish the impossible but
falls into the absurd. After a while he notices that people talk
about him, make unfavourable remarks about him, and even
scoff at him. He believes a far-reaching conspiracy exists to
frustrate his discoveries and render them objects of ridicule.
By this means his unconscious brings about the same results
that his self-criticism could have attained, but again only to
the detriment of the individual, because the criticism is
projected into his surroundings.</p>

<p>An especially typical form of unconscious compensation&mdash;to
give a further example&mdash;is the paranoia of the alcoholic.
The alcoholic loses his love for his wife; the unconscious
compensation tries to lead him back again to his duty, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
only partially succeeds, for it causes him to become jealous
of his wife as if he still loved her. As we know, he may
even go so far as to kill both his wife and himself, merely
out of jealousy. In other words, his love for his wife has not
been entirely lost, it has simply become subliminal; but from
the realm of the unconscious it can now only reappear in the
form of jealousy.</p>

<p>We see something of a similar nature in the case of
religious converts. One who turns from protestantism to
catholicism has, as is well known, the tendency to be somewhat
fanatical. His protestantism is not entirely relinquished,
but has merely disappeared into the unconscious,
where it is constantly at work as a counter-argument against
the newly acquired catholicism. Therefore the new convert
feels himself constrained to defend the faith he has adopted
in a more or less fanatical way. It is exactly the same in
the case of the paranoiac, who feels himself constantly constrained
to defend himself against all external criticism,
because his delusional system is too much threatened from
within.</p>

<p>The strange manner in which these compensating influences
break through into the conscious mind derives its
peculiarities from the fact that they have to struggle against
the resistances already existing in the conscious mind, and
therefore present themselves to the patient's mind in a
thoroughly distorted manner. And secondly, these compensating
equivalents are obliged necessarily to present
themselves in the language of the unconscious&mdash;that is, in
material of a heterogeneous and subliminal nature. For
all the material of the conscious mind which is of no
further value, and can find no suitable employment, becomes
subliminal, such as all those forgotten infantile and phantastic
creations that have ever entered the heads of men, of which
only the legends and myths still remain. For certain reasons
which I cannot discuss further here, this latter material is
frequently found in dementia præcox.</p>

<p>I hope I may have been able to give in this brief contribution,
which I feel to be unfortunately incomplete, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
glimpse of the situation as it presents itself to me of the
importance of the unconscious in psychopathology. It would
be impossible in a short discourse to give an adequate idea
of all the work that has already been done in this field.</p>

<p>To sum up, I may say that the function of the unconscious
in conditions of mental disturbance is essentially a
compensation of the content of the conscious mind. But
because of the characteristic condition of one-sidedness of the
conscious striving in all such cases, the compensating
correctives are rendered useless. It is, however, inevitable
that these unconscious tendencies break through into the
conscious mind, but in adapting themselves to the character
of the one-sided conscious aims, it is only possible for them
to appear in a distorted and unacceptable form.</p>

<p class="p3">A CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL
TYPES<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>


<p>It is well known that in their general physiognomy hysteria
and dementia præcox present a striking contrast, which is
seen particularly in the attitude of the sufferers towards
the external world. The reactions provoked in the hysteric
surpass the normal level of intensity of feeling, whilst this
level is not reached at all by the precocious dement. The
picture presented by these contrasted illnesses is one of
exaggerated emotivity in the one, and extreme apathy in
the other, with regard to the environment. In their personal
relations this difference is very marked. Abstraction creates
some exceptions here, for we remain in affective rapport with
our hysterical patients, which is not the case in dementia
præcox.</p>

<p>The opposition between these two nosological types is
also seen in the rest of their symptomatology. From the
intellectual point of view the products of hysterical imagination
may be accounted for in a very natural and human way
in each individual case by the antecedents and individual
history of the patient; while the inventions of the precocious
dement, on the contrary, are more nearly related to dreams
than to normal consciousness, and they display moreover an
incontestably archaic tendency, wherein mythological creations
of primitive imagination are more in evidence than the
personal memories of the patient. From the physical point
of view we do not find in dementia præcox those symptoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
so common in the hysteric, which simulate well known or
severe organic affections.</p>

<p>All this clearly indicates that hysteria is characterised
by a centrifugal tendency of the libido,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> whilst in dementia
præcox its tendency is centripetal. The reverse occurs,
however, where the illness has fully established its compensatory
effects. In the hysteric the libido is always
hampered in its movements of expansion and forced to
regress upon itself; one observes that such individuals cease
to partake in the common life, are wrapped up in their
phantasies, keep their beds, or are unable to live outside
their sick-rooms, etc. The precocious dement, on the contrary,
during the incubation of his illness turns away from the
outer world in order to withdraw into himself; but when the
period of morbid compensation arrives, he seems constrained
to draw attention to himself, and to force himself upon the
notice of those around him, by his extravagant, insupportable,
or directly aggressive conduct.</p>

<p>I propose to use the terms "extroversion" and "introversion"
to describe these two opposite directions of the
libido, further qualifying them, however, as "regressive" in
morbid cases where phantasies, fictions, or phantastic interpretations,
inspired by emotivity, falsify the perceptions of
the subject about things, or about himself. We say that he
is extroverted when he gives his fundamental interest to the
outer or objective world, and attributes an all-important and
essential value to it: he is introverted, on the contrary, when
the objective world suffers a sort of depreciation, or want of
consideration, for the sake of the exaltation of the individual
himself, who then monopolising all the interest, grows to
believe no one but himself worthy of consideration. I will
call "regressive extroversion" the phenomenon which Freud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
calls "transference" (Übertragung), by which the hysteric
projects into the objective world the illusions, or subjective
values of his feelings. In the same way I shall call "regressive
introversion," the opposite pathological phenomenon
which we find in dementia præcox, where the subject himself
suffers these phantastical transfigurations.</p>

<p>It is obvious that these two contrary movements of the
libido, as simple psychic mechanisms, may play a part alternately
in the same individual, since after all they serve the
same purpose by different methods&mdash;namely, to minister to his
well-being. Freud has taught us that in the mechanism of
hysterical transference the individual aims at getting rid of
disagreeable memories or impressions, in order to free himself
from painful complexes, by a process of "repression." Conversely
in the mechanism of introversion, the personality
tends to concentrate itself upon its complexes, and with them,
to isolate itself from external reality, by a process which is
not properly speaking "repression," but which would be better
rendered perhaps by the term "depreciation" (Entwertung)
of the objective world.</p>

<p>The existence of two mental affections so opposite in
character as hysteria and dementia præcox, in which the
contrast rests on the almost exclusive supremacy of extroversion
or introversion, suggests that these two psychological
types may exist equally well in normal persons, who may be
characterised by the relative predominance of one or other
of the two mechanisms. Psychiatrists know very well that
before either illness is fully declared, patients already present
the characteristic type, traces of which are to be found from
the earliest years of life. As Binet pointed out so well, the
neurotic only accentuates and shews in relief the characteristic
traits of his personality. One knows, of course, that the
hysterical character is not simply the product of the illness,
but pre-existed it in a measure. And Hoch has shown by
his researches into the histories of his dementia præcox
patients, that this is also the case with them; dissociations
or eccentricities were present before the onset of the illness.
If this is so, one may certainly expect to meet the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
contrast between psychological temperaments outside the
sphere of pathology. It is moreover easy to cull from literature
numerous examples which bear witness to the actual
existence of these two opposite types of mentality. Without
pretending to exhaust the subject, I will give a few striking
examples.</p>

<p>In my opinion, we owe the best observations on this
subject to the philosophy of William James.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> He lays down
the principle that no matter what may be the temperament
of a "professional philosopher," it is this temperament which
he feels himself forced to express and to justify in his philosophy.
And starting from this idea, which is altogether
in accord with the spirit of psychoanalysis, divides philosophers
into two classes: the "tender-minded," who are only
interested in the inner life and spiritual things; and the
"tough-minded," who lay most stress on material things
and objective reality. We see that these two classes are
actuated by exactly opposite tendencies of the libido: the
"tender-minded" represent introversion, the "tough-minded"
extroversion.</p>

<p>James says that the tender-minded are characterised by
rationalism; they are men of principles and of systems,
they aspire to dominate experience and to transcend it by
abstract reasoning, by their logical deductions, and purely
rational conceptions. They care little for facts, and the
multiplicity of phenomena hardly embarrasses them at all:
they forcibly fit data into their ideal constructions, and
reduce everything to their <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> premises. This was the
method of Hegel in settling beforehand the number of
the planets. In the domain of mental pathology we again
meet this kind of philosopher in paranoiacs, who, without
being disquieted by the flat contradictions presented by experience,
impose their delirious conceptions on the universe,
and find means of interpreting everything, and according to
Adler "arranging" everything, in conformity with their
morbidly preconceived system.</p>

<p>The other traits which James depicts in this type follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
naturally from its fundamental character. The tender-minded
man, he says, is intellectual, idealist, optimist,
religious, partisan of free-will, a monist, and a dogmatist.
All these qualities betray the almost exclusive concentration of
the libido upon the intellectual life. This concentration upon
the inner world of thought is nothing else than introversion.
In so far as experience plays a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> with these philosophers,
it serves only as an allurement or fillip to abstraction, in
response to the imperative need to fit forcibly all the chaos
of the universe within well-defined limits, which are, in
the last resort, the creation of a spirit obedient to its
subjective values.</p>

<p>The tough-minded man is positivist and empiricist. He
regards only matters of fact. Experience is his master, his
exclusive guide and inspiration. It is only empirical phenomena
demonstrable in the outside world which count. Thought
is merely a reaction to external experience. In the eyes of
these philosophers principles are never of such value as
facts; they can only reflect and describe the sequence of
phenomena and cannot construct a system. Thus their
theories are exposed to contradiction under the overwhelming
accumulation of empirical material. Psychic reality for
the positivist limits itself to the observation and experience
of pleasure and pain; he does not go beyond that, nor does
he recognise the rights of philosophical thought. Remaining
on the ever-changing surface of the phenomenal world,
he partakes himself of its instability; carried away in the
chaotic tumult of the universe, he sees all its aspects, all
its theoretical and practical possibilities, but he never
arrives at the unity or the fixity of a settled system, which
alone could satisfy the idealist or tender-minded. The positivist
depreciates all values in reducing them to elements
lower than themselves; he explains the higher by the lower,
and dethrones it, by showing that it is "nothing but such
another thing," which has no value in itself.</p>

<p>From these general characteristics, the others which
James points out logically follow. The positivist is a sensualist,
giving greater value to the specific realm of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
senses than to reflection which transcends it. He is a
materialist and a pessimist, for he knows only too well the
hopeless uncertainty of the course of things. He is irreligious,
not being in a state to hold firmly to the realities
of the inner world as opposed to the pressure of external
facts; he is a determinist and fatalist, only able to show
resignation; a pluralist, incapable of all synthesis; and
finally a sceptic, as a last and inevitable consequence of all
the rest.</p>

<p>The expressions, therefore, used by James, show clearly
that the diversity of types is the result of a different localisation
of the libido; this libido is the magic power in the depth
of our being, which, following the personality, carries it sometimes
towards internal life, and sometimes towards the objective
world. James compares, for example, the religious
subjectivism of the idealist, and the quasi-religious attitude
of the contemporary empiricist: "Our esteem for facts has
not neutralised in us all religiousness. It is itself almost
religious. Our scientific temper is devout."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>A second parallel is furnished by Wilhelm Ostwald,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
who divides "savants" and men of genius into classics and
romantics. The latter are distinguished by their rapid
reactions, their extremely prompt and abundant production
of ideas and projects, some of which are badly digested and of
doubtful value. They are admirable and brilliant masters,
loving to teach, of a contagious ardour and enthusiasm,
which attracts many pupils, and makes them founders of
schools, exercising great personal influence. Herein our
type of extroversion is easily recognised. The classics of
Ostwald are, on the contrary, slow to react; they produce
with much difficulty, are little capable of teaching or of
exercising direct personal influence, and lacking enthusiasm
are paralysed by their own severe criticism, living apart and
absorbed in themselves, making scarcely any disciples, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
producing works of finished perfection which often bring
them posthumous fame. All these characteristics correspond
to introversion.</p>

<p>We find a further very valuable example in the æsthetic
theory of Warringer. Borrowing from A. Riegl his expression
"Volonté d'art absolue" to express the internal force which
inspires the artist, he distinguishes two forms, viz. sympathy
(Einfühlung) and abstraction; and the term which he employs
indicates that here, too, we witness the activity of the
push of the libido, the stirring of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan vital</i>. "In the
same way," says Warringer, "as the sympathetic impulse
finds its satisfaction in organic beauty, so abstract impulse
discovers beauty in the inorganic, which is the negation of all
life, in crystallised forms, and in a general manner wherever
the severity of abstract law reigns." Whilst sympathy represents
the warmth of passion which carries it into the presence
of the object in order to assimilate it and penetrate it with
emotional values; abstraction, on the other hand, despoils the
object of all that could recall life, and grasps it by purely
intellectual thought, crystallised and fixed into the rigid
forms of law,&mdash;the universal, the typical. Bergson also makes
use of these images of crystallisation, solidification, etc., to
illustrate the essence of intellectual abstraction.</p>

<p>Warringer's "abstraction" represents the process which
I have already remarked as a consequence of introversion,
namely, the exaltation of the intellect, in the place of the
depreciated reality of the external world. "Sympathy" corresponds
in fact to extroversion, for, as Lipps has pointed out,
"What I perceive sympathetically in an object is, in a
general manner life, and life is power, internal work, effort,
and execution. To live, in a word, is to act, and to act
is to experience intimately the force which we give out;
experience creates activity, which is essentially of a spontaneous
character." "Æsthetic enjoyment," said Warringer,
"is the enjoyment of one's own self projected into the
"object," a formula which corresponds absolutely with our
definition of transference. This æsthetic conception does not
refer to the positivist in James's sense; it is rather the attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of the idealist for whom psychological reality only is interesting,
and worthy of consideration." Warringer adds, "what is
essential lies not in the gradation of the feeling, but pre-eminently
in the feeling itself; that is to say, the inner movement,
the intimate life, the unfolding of the subject's own
activity; the value of a line or of a form, depends in our
eyes on the biological value it holds for us; that which gives
beauty is solely our own vital feeling, which we unconsciously
project into it." This view corresponds exactly with my own
way of understanding the theory of the libido, in attempting
to keep the true balance between the two psychological
opposites of introversion and extroversion.</p>

<p>The polar opposite of sympathy is abstraction. The
impulse of abstraction is conceived by Warringer "as the
result of a great internal conflict of the human soul in
the presence of the external world, and from the religious
standpoint, it corresponds to a strong transcendental colouring
of all the representations man has made to himself of reality."
We recognise clearly in this definition the primordial tendency
to introversion. To the introverted type the universe does
not appear beautiful and desirable, but disquieting, and even
dangerous; it is a manifestation against which the subject puts
himself on the defensive; he entrenches himself in his inner
fastness, and fortifies himself therein by the invention of
geometrical figures, full of repose, perfectly clear even in
their minutest details, the primitive magic power of which
assures him of domination over the surrounding world.</p>

<p>"The need of abstraction is the origin of all art," says
Warringer. Here is a great principle, which gains weighty
confirmation from the fact that precocious dements reproduce
forms and figures which present the closest analogy to those
of primitive humanity, not only in their thoughts but also
in their drawings.</p>

<p>We should recall that Schiller had already tried to
formulate the same presentation in what he calls the naïve
and sentimental types. The latter is in quest of nature, whilst
the former is itself "all nature." Schiller also saw that
these two types result from the predominance of psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
mechanisms which might be met with in one and the same
individual. "It is not only in the same poet," he said, "but
even in the same work that these two types of mentality are
found united.... The naïve poet pursues only nature and
feeling in their simplicity, and all his effort is limited to the
imitation and reproduction of reality. The sentimental poet,
on the contrary, reflects the impression he receives from
objects. The object here is allied to an idea, and the poetic
power of the work depends on this alliance." These quotations
shew what types Schiller had in view, and one recognises
their fundamental identity with those with which we are
here dealing.</p>

<p>We find another instance in Nietzsche's contrast between
the minds of Apollo and of Dionysus. The example which
Nietzsche uses to illustrate this contrast is instructive&mdash;namely,
that between a dream and intoxication. In a dream
the individual is shut up in himself, in intoxication, on the
contrary, he forgets himself to the highest degree, and, set
free from his self-consciousness, plunges into the multiplicity
of the objective world. To depict Apollo, Nietzsche borrows
the words of Schopenhauer, "As upon a tumultuous sea,
which disgorges and swallows by turns, lost to view in the
mountains of foaming waves, the mariner remains seated
tranquilly on his plank, full of confidence in his frail barque;
so individual man, in a world of troubles, lives passive and
serene, relying with confidence on the principle of 'individuation.'"
"Yes," continues Nietzsche, "we might say
that the unshakeable confidence in this principle, and the
calm security of those whom it has inspired, have found
in Apollo their most sublime expression, and we may always
recognise in him the most splendid and divine personification
of the principle of making an individual." The Apollien
state, as Nietzsche conceives it, is consequently the withdrawal
into oneself, that is, introversion. Conversely in the
Dionysian state, psychic intoxication, indicates in his view the
unloosening of a torrent of libido which expends itself upon
things. "This is not only," says Nietzsche, "the alliance
of man with man, which finds itself confirmed afresh under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the Dionysian enchantment; it is alienated Nature, hostile
or enslaved, which also celebrates her reconciliation with her
prodigal child,&mdash;man. Spontaneously Earth offers her gifts
and the wild beasts from rock and desert draw near peacefully.
The car of Dionysus is lost under flowers and garlands;
panthers and tigers approach under his yoke."</p>

<p>If we change Beethoven's "Hymn of Praise" into a picture,
and giving rein to our imagination, contemplate the millions
of beings prostrated and trembling in the dust, at such a
moment the Dionysian intoxication will be near at hand.
Then is the slave free; then all the rigid and hostile barriers
which poverty and arbitrary or insolent custom have established
between man and man are broken down. Now, by
means of this gospel of universal harmony, each feels himself
not only reunited, reconciled, fused with his neighbour,
but actually identified with him, as if the veil of "Maïa was
torn away, nothing remaining of it but a few shreds floating
before the mystery of the Primordial Unity."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> It would be
superfluous to add comment to these quotations.</p>

<p>In concluding this series of examples culled outside my
own special domain, I will quote the linguistic hypothesis of
Finck,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> where we also see the duality in question. The
structure of language, according to Finck, presents two
principal types: in one the subject is generally conceived as
active: "I see him," "I strike him down;" in the other the
subject experiences and feels, and it is the object which acts:
"He appears to me," "He succumbs to me." The first type
clearly shews the libido as going out of the subject,&mdash;this
is a centrifugal movement; the second as coming out of the
object,&mdash;this movement is centripetal. We meet with this
latter introverted type especially in the primitive languages
of the Esquimaux.</p>

<p>In the domain of psychiatry also these two types have
been described by Otto Gross,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> who distinguishes two forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of mental debility: the one a diffuse and shallow consciousness,
the other a concentrated and deep consciousness. The
first is characterised by weakness of the consecutive function,
the second by its excessive reinforcement. Gross has recognised
that the consecutive function is in intimate relation
with affectivity, from which we might infer that he is dealing
once more with our two psychological types. The relation he
establishes between maniac depressive insanity and the state
of diffuse or extended and shallow mental disease shows that
the latter represents the extroverted type; and the relation
between the psychology of the paranoiac and repressed
mentality, indicates the identity of the former with the introverted
type.</p>

<p>After the foregoing considerations no one will be astonished
to find that in the domain of psychoanalysis we also have
to reckon with the existence of these two psychological types.</p>

<p>On the one side we meet with a theory which is essentially
reductive, pluralist, causal and sensualist; this is Freud's
standpoint. This theory limits itself rigidly to empirical
facts, and traces back complexes to their antecedents and
their elemental factors. It regards the psychological life as
being only an effect, a reaction to the environment, and
accords the greatest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> and the largest place to sensation.
On the other side we have the diametrically opposed
theory of Adler<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> which is an entirely philosophical and
finalistic one. In it phenomena are not reducible to earlier
and very primitive factors, but are conceived as "arrangements,"
the outcome of intentions and of ends of an extremely
complex nature. It is no longer the view of causality but
of finality which dominates researches: the history of the
patient and the concrete influences of the environment are
of much less importance than the dominating principles, the
"fictions directrices," of the individual. It is not essential
for him to depend upon the object, and to find in it his fill of
subjective enjoyment, but to protect his own individuality
and to guarantee it against the hostile influences of the
environment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst Freud's psychology has for its predominant note
the centrifugal tendency, which demands its happiness and
satisfaction in the objective world, in that of Adler the chief
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> belongs to the centripetal movement, which tends to
the supremacy of the subject, to his triumph and his liberty,
as opposed to the overwhelming forces of existence. The
expedient to which the type described by Freud has recourse
is "infantile transference," by means of which he projects
phantasy into the object and finds a compensation for the
difficulties of life in this transfiguration. In the type described
by Adler what is characteristic is, on the contrary, the
"virile protest," personal resistance, the efficacious safeguard
which the individual provides for himself, in affirming
and stubbornly enclosing himself in his dominating ideas.</p>

<p>The difficult task of elaborating a psychology which should
pay equal attention to the two types of mentality belongs to
the future.</p>

<p class="p3">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF DREAMS<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>


<p>A dream is a psychic structure which at first sight appears
to be in striking contrast with conscious thought, because
judging by its form and substance it apparently does not lie
within the continuity of development of the conscious contents,
it is not integral to it, but is a mere external and
apparently accidental occurrence. Its mode of genesis is in
itself sufficient to isolate a dream from the other contents of
the conscious, for it is a survival of a peculiar psychic activity
which takes place during sleep, and does not originate in the
manifest and clearly logical and emotional continuity of the
event experienced.</p>

<p>But a careful observer should have no difficulty in discovering
that a dream is not entirely severed from the continuity
of the conscious, for in almost every dream certain
details are found which have their origin in the impressions,
thoughts, or states of mind of one of the preceding days. In
so far a certain continuity does exist, albeit a <em>retrograde</em> one.
But any one keenly interested in the dream problem cannot
have failed to observe that a dream has also a <em>progressive</em>
continuity&mdash;if such an expression be permitted&mdash;since dreams
occasionally exert a remarkable influence upon the conscious
mental life, even of persons who cannot be considered superstitious
or particularly abnormal. These occasional after-effects
are usually seen in a more or less distinct change in
the dreamer's frame of mind.</p>

<p>It is probably in consequence of this loose connection
with the other conscious contents, that the recollected dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
is so extremely unstable. Many dreams baffle all attempts
at reproduction, even immediately after waking; others can
only be remembered with doubtful accuracy, and comparatively
few can be termed really distinct and clearly reproduceable.
This peculiar reaction with regard to recollection
may be understood by considering the characteristics of the
various elements combined in a dream. The combination of
ideas in dreams is essentially <em>phantastic</em>; they are linked
together in a sequence which, as a rule, is quite foreign to
our current way of thinking, and in striking contrast to the
logical sequence of ideas which we consider to be a special
characteristic of conscious mental processes.</p>

<p>It is to this characteristic that dreams owe the common
epithet of "meaningless." Before pronouncing this verdict,
we must reflect that dreams and their chains of ideas are
something that <em>we</em> do not understand. Such a verdict would
therefore be merely a projection of our non-comprehension
upon its object. But that would not prevent its own peculiar
meaning being inherent in a dream.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that for centuries endeavours have
been made to extract a prophetic meaning from dreams,
Freud's discovery is practically the first successful attempt
to find their real significance. His work merits the term
"scientific," because he has evolved a technique which, not
only he, but many other investigators also assert achieves
its object, namely, the understanding of the meaning of the
dream. This meaning is not identical with the one which
the manifest dream content seems to indicate.</p>

<p>This is not the place for a critical discussion of Freud's
psychology of dreams. But I will try to give a brief summary
of what may be regarded as more or less established facts of
dream psychology to-day.</p>

<p>The first question we must discuss is, whence do we deduce
the justification for attributing to dreams any other significance
than the one indicated in the unsatisfying fragmentary
meaning of the manifest dream content?</p>

<p>As regards this point a particularly weighty argument is
the fact that Freud discovered the hidden meaning of dreams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
by <em>empiric</em> and not <em>deductive</em> methods. A further argument
in favour of a possible hidden, as opposed to the manifest
meaning of dreams, is obtained by comparing dream-phantasies
with other phantasies (day-dreams and the like) in one
and the same individual. It is not difficult to conceive that
such day-phantasies have not merely a superficial, concrete
meaning, but also a deeper psychological meaning. It is
solely on account of the brevity that I must impose upon
myself, that I do not submit materials in proof of this. But
I should like to point out that what may be said about the
meaning of phantasies, is well illustrated by an old and
widely diffused type of imaginative story, of which Æsop's
Fables are typical examples, wherein, for instance, the story
is some objectively impossible phantasy about the deeds of
a lion and an ass. The concrete superficial meaning of the
fable is an impossible phantasm, but the hidden moral
meaning is plain upon reflection. It is characteristic that
children are pleased and satisfied with the exoteric meaning
of the story. However, the best argument for the existence
of a hidden meaning in dreams is provided by conscientious
application of the technical procedure to solve the manifest
dream content.</p>

<p>This brings us to our second main point, viz.&mdash;the question
of analytic procedure. Here again I desire neither to
defend nor to criticise Freud's views and discoveries, but
rather to confine myself to what seem to me to be firmly
established facts.</p>

<p>The fact that a dream is a psychic structure, does not
give us the slightest ground for assuming that it obeys laws
and designs other than those applicable to any other psychic
structure. According to the maxim: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">principia explicandi
pr&oelig;ter necessitatem non sunt multiplicanda</i>, we have to treat
dreams, in analysis, just as any other psychic structure, until
experience teaches us some better way.</p>

<p>We know that every psychic construction considered
from the standpoint of causality, is the resultant of previous
psychic contents. Moreover, we know also that every psychic
structure, considered from the standpoint of finality, has its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
own peculiar meaning and purpose in the actual psychic
process. This standard must also be applied to dreams.
When, therefore, we seek a psychological explanation of a
dream, we must first know what were the preceding experiences
out of which it is combined. We must trace the antecedents
of every element in the dream picture. For example: some
one dreams "<em>that he is walking in a street, a child is running
in front of him, who is suddenly run over by a motor-car</em>." We
will trace the antecedents of this dream-picture, with the
aid of the dreamer's recollections.</p>

<p>He recognises the street as one down which he had walked
on the previous day. The child he acknowledges as his
brother's child, whom he had seen on the previous evening
when visiting his brother. The motor accident reminds him
of an accident that had actually occurred a few days before,
but of which he had only read an account in a newspaper.
Popular opinion is known to be satisfied with this kind of
explanation. People say: "Oh, that is why I dreamt such
and such a thing!"</p>

<p>Obviously this explanation is absolutely unsatisfactory
from a scientific standpoint. The dreamer walked down
many streets on the previous day; why was this particular
one selected? He had read about several accidents; why did
he select just this one? The mere disclosure of an antecedent
is by no means sufficient; for a plausible determination
of the dream presentation can only be obtained from the competition
of various determinants. The collection of additional
material proceeds, according to the principle of recollection
that has been called the <cite>Association Method</cite>. The result,
as will easily be understood, is the admission of a mass
of multifarious and quite heterogeneous material, having
apparently nothing in common but the fact of its evident
associative connection with the dream contents, since it has
been reproduced by means of this content.</p>

<p>How far the collection of such material should go, is an
important question from the technical point of view. Since
the entire psychic content of a life may be ultimately disclosed
from any single starting point, theoretically the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
previous life-experience might be found in every dream. But
we only need to assemble just so much material as is absolutely
necessary in order to comprehend the dream's meaning.
The limitation of the material is obviously an arbitrary proceeding,
according to that principle of Kant's whereby to
<em>comprehend</em> is "<em>to perceive to the extent necessary for our
purpose</em>." For instance, when undertaking a survey of the
causes of the French Revolution, we could, in amassing our
material, include not only the history of medieval France but
also that of Rome and Greece, which certainly would not be
"necessary for our purpose," since we can comprehend the
historical genesis of the Revolution from much more limited
material.</p>

<p>Except for the aforesaid arbitrary limitation, the collecting
of material lies outside the investigator's discretion.
The material gathered must now be sifted and examined,
according to principles which are always applied to the
examination of historical or any empirical scientific material.
The method is an essentially comparative one, that obviously
cannot be applied automatically, but is largely dependent
upon the skill and aim of the investigator.</p>

<p>When a psychological fact has to be explained, it must
be remembered that psychological data necessitate a twofold
point of view, namely, that of <em>causality</em> and that of
<em>finality</em>. I use the word finality intentionally, in order to
avoid confusion with the idea of "teleology." I use finality
to denote immanent psychological teleology. In so far as
we apply the view point of causality to the material that
has been associated with the dream, we reduce the manifest
dream content to certain fundamental tendencies or ideas.
These, as one would expect, are elementary and universal in
character.</p>

<p>For instance, a young patient dreams as follows: "<em>I am
standing in a strange garden, and pluck an apple from a tree.
I look about cautiously, to make sure no one sees me.</em>"</p>

<p>The associated dream material is a memory of having
once, when a boy, plucked a couple of pears surreptitiously
from another person's garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>The feeling of having a bad conscience, which is a
prominent feature in the dream, reminds him of a situation
he experienced on the previous day. He met a young lady
in the street&mdash;a casual acquaintance&mdash;and exchanged a few
words with her. At that moment a gentleman passed whom
he knew, whereupon our patient was suddenly seized with
a curious feeling of embarrassment, as if he had done something
wrong. He associated the apple with the scene in
Paradise, together with the fact that he had never really
understood why the eating of the forbidden fruit should have
been fraught with such dire consequences for our first parents.
This had always made him feel angry; it seemed to him an
unjust act of God, for God had made men as they were, with
all their curiosity and greed.</p>

<p>Another association was, that sometimes his father had
punished him for certain things in a way that seemed to him
incomprehensible. The worst punishment had been bestowed
after he had secretly watched girls bathing.</p>

<p>That led up to the confession that he had recently begun
a love affair with a housemaid, but had not yet carried it
through to a conclusion. On the day before the dream he
had had a <em>rendezvous</em> with her.</p>

<p>Upon reviewing this material we see that the dream
contains a very transparent reference to the last-named
incident. The connecting associative material shows that
the apple episode is palpably meant for an erotic scene. For
various other reasons, too, it may be considered extremely
probable that this experience of the previous day is operative
even in this dream. In the dream the young man
plucks the apple of Paradise, which in reality he has not yet
plucked. The remainder of the material associated with the
dream is concerned with another experience of the previous
day, namely, with the peculiar feeling of a <em>bad conscience</em>,
which seized the dreamer when he was talking to his casual
lady acquaintance; this, again, was connected with the fall of
man in Paradise, and finally with an erotic misdemeanour of
his childhood, for which his father had punished him severely.
All these associations are linked together by the idea of <em>guilt</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first place we will consider this material from
Freud's view-point of causality; in other words, we will
"interpret" it, to use Freud's expression. A wish has been
left unfulfilled from the day before the dream. In the dream
this wish is realised in the <em>symbolical</em> apple scene. But why
is this realisation disguised and hidden under a symbolic
image instead of being expressed in a distinctly sexual
thought? Freud would refer to the unmistakable sense of
guilt shown up by the material, and say the morality that
has been inculcated in the young man from childhood
is bent on repressing such wishes, and to that end brands
the natural craving as immoral and reprehensible. The
suppressed immoral thought can therefore only achieve
expression by means of a <em>symbol</em>. As these thoughts are
incompatible with the moral content of the conscious ego,
a psychic factor adopted by Freud called the <em>Censor</em>, prevents
this wish from passing undisguised into consciousness.</p>

<p>Reviewing the dream from the standpoint of finality,
which I contrast with that of Freud, does not&mdash;as I wish to
establish explicitly&mdash;involve a denial of the dream's <em>causæ</em>,
but rather a different interpretation of the associative
material collected around the dream. The material facts
remain the same, but the standard by which they are
measured is altered. The question may be formulated
simply as follows: What is this dream's purpose? What
should it effect? These questions are not arbitrary, in
as much as they may be applied to every psychic activity.
Everywhere the question of the "why" and "wherefore"
may be raised.</p>

<p>It is clear that the material added by the dream to the
previous day's erotic experience, chiefly emphasises the sense
of guilt in the erotic act. The same association has already
been shown to be operative in another experience of the
previous day, in the meeting with his casual lady acquaintance,
when the feeling of a bad conscience was automatically
and inexplicably aroused, as if, in that instance, too, the
young man had done something wrong. This experience
also plays a part in the dream, which is even intensified by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the association of additional, appropriate material; the
erotic experience of the day before, being depicted by the
story of the Fall which was followed by such a severe
punishment.</p>

<p>I maintain that there exists in the dreamer an unconscious
propensity or <em>tendency to conceive his erotic experiences
as guilty</em>. It is most characteristic that the association
with the Fall of Man should ensue, the young man having
never really grasped why the punishment should have been
so drastic. This association throws light upon the reasons
why the dreamer did not think simply, "I am doing what
is not right." Obviously he does not <em>know</em> that he might
condemn his own conduct as morally wrong. This is
actually the case. His conscious belief is that his conduct
does not matter in the least morally, as all his friends
were acting in the same way; besides, for other reasons
too, is unable to understand why a fuss should be made
about it.</p>

<p>Whether this dream should be considered full or void
of meaning depends upon a very important question, viz.
whether the standpoint of morality, handed down to us
through the ages by our forefathers is held to be full or
void of meaning. I do not wish to wander off into a philosophical
discussion of this question, but would merely observe
that mankind must obviously have had very strong reasons
for devising this morality, otherwise it would be truly incomprehensible
why such restraints should be imposed upon
one of man's strongest cravings. If we attach due value to
this fact, we are bound to pronounce this dream to be full of
meaning, for it reveals to the young man the necessity of
facing his erotic conduct boldly from the view point of
morality. Primitive races have in some respects extremely
strict legislation concerning sexuality. This fact proves
that sexual morality is a not-to-be-neglected factor in
the soul's higher functions, but deserves to be taken fully
into account. In the case in question it should be added,
that the young man&mdash;influenced by his friends' example&mdash;somewhat
thoughtlessly let himself be guided exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
by his erotic cravings, unmindful of the fact that man is a
morally responsible being and must perforce submit&mdash;voluntarily
or involuntarily&mdash;to a morality that he himself has
created.</p>

<p>In this dream we can discern a compensating function of
the unconscious, consisting in the fact that <em>those thoughts,
propensities, and tendencies of a human personality, which in
conscious life are too seldom recognised, come spontaneously into
action in the sleeping state, when to a large extent the conscious
process is disconnected</em>.</p>

<p>The question might certainly be raised, of what use is
this to the dreamer if he does not understand the dream?</p>

<p>To this I must remark that to understand is not an
exclusively intellectual process, for&mdash;as experience proves&mdash;man
may be influenced&mdash;nay, even very effectually convinced&mdash;by
innumerable things, of which he has no intellectual
understanding. I will merely remind my readers of the
efficacy of religious symbols.</p>

<p>The example given above might suggest the thought that
the function of dreams is a distinctly "moral" one. Such it
appears to be in this case, but if we recall the formula according
to which dreams contain the subliminal materials of a
given moment, we cannot speak simply of a "moral" function.
For it is worthy of note that the dreams of those persons
whose actions are morally unexceptionable, bring materials to
light that might well be characterised as "immoral" in the
current meaning of that term. Thus it is significant that
St. Augustine was glad that God did not hold him responsible
for his dreams. The unconscious is the unknown of a given
moment, therefore it is not surprising that all those aspects
that are essential for a totally different point of view
should be added by dreams to the conscious psychological
factors of a given moment. It is evident that this function
of dreams signifies a psychological adjustment, a compensation
essential for properly balanced action. In the conscious
process of reflection it is indispensable that, so far as possible,
we should realise all the aspects and consequences of a
problem, in order to find the right solution. This process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
is continued automatically in the more or less unconscious
state of sleep, wherever&mdash;as our previous experience seems
to show&mdash;all those other points of view occur to the dreamer
(at least by way of allusion) that during the day were underestimated
or even totally ignored; in other words, were
comparatively unconscious.</p>

<p>As regards the much-discussed <em>symbolism</em> of dreams, the
value attached to it varies according to whether the standpoint
of causality or of finality is adopted. According to
Freud's causal view point it proceeds from a <em>craving</em>, viz.
from the suppressed dream-wish. This craving is always
somewhat simple and primitive, and is able to disguise itself
under manifold forms. For instance, the young man in
question might just as well have dreamt that he had to open
a door with a key, or that he had to travel by aeroplane, or
that he was kissing his mother, etc. From this standpoint
all those things would have had the same meaning. In this
way, the typical adherents of Freud's school have come to
the point of interpreting&mdash;to give a gross instance&mdash;almost
all long objects in dreams as phallic symbols.</p>

<p>From the view-point of finality, the various dream pictures
have each their own peculiar value. For instance, if the
young man, instead of dreaming of the apple scene, had
dreamt he had to open a door with a key, the altered dream
picture would have furnished associative material of an
essentially different character; that, again, would have
resulted in the conscious situation being supplemented by
associations of a totally different kind from those connected
with the apple scene. From this point of view, it is the
diversity of the dream's mode of expression that is full of
meaning, and not the uniformity in its significance. The
causal view-point tends by its very nature towards uniformity
of meaning, that is, towards a fixed significance of symbols.
On the other hand, the final view-point perceives in an
altered dream picture, the expression of an altered psychological
situation. It recognises no fixed meaning of symbols.
From this standpoint all the dream pictures are important
in themselves, each one having a special significance of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
own, to which it owes its inclusion in the dream. Keeping to
our previous example, we see that from the standpoint of
finality the symbol in this dream is approximately equivalent
to a parable; it does not conceal, but it teaches. The apple
scene recalls vividly the sense of guilt, at the same time
disguising the real deed of our first parents.</p>

<p>It is obvious we reach very dissimilar interpretations of
the meaning of the dream, according to the point of view
adopted. The question now arises, which is the better or
truer version? After all, for us therapeuts it is a practical
and not a merely theoretical necessity that leads us to seek
for some comprehension of the meaning of dreams. In
treating our patients we must for practical reasons endeavour
to lay hold of any means that will enable us to train them
effectually. It should be quite evident from the foregoing
example, that the material associated with the dream has
opened up a question calculated to make many matters clear
to the young man, which, hitherto, he has heedlessly overlooked.
But by disregarding these things he was really
overlooking something in himself, for he possesses a moral
standard and a moral need just like any other man. By
trying to live without taking this fact into consideration,
his life is one-sided and incomplete, so to say inco-ordinate;
with the same consequences for the psychological life as a
one-sided and incomplete diet would have for the physical.
In order to develop a person's individuality and independence
to the uttermost, we need to bring to fruition all those
functions that have hitherto attained but little conscious
development or none at all. In order to achieve this aim,
we must for therapeutic reasons enter into all those unconscious
aspects of things brought forward by the dream
material. This makes it abundantly clear that the view-point
of finality is singularly important as an aid to the
practical development of the individual.</p>

<p>The view-point of causality is obviously more in accord
with the scientific spirit of our time, with its strictly causalistic
reasoning. Much may be said for Freud's view as a
scientific explanation of dream psychology. But I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
dispute its completeness, for the psyche cannot be conceived
merely from the causal aspect, but necessitates also a final
view-point. Only a combination of both points of view&mdash;which
has not yet been attained to the satisfaction of the scientific
mind, owing to great difficulties both of a practical and
theoretical nature&mdash;can give us a more complete conception
of the essence of dreams.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I would like to treat briefly of some further problems
of dream psychology, that border on the general discussion
of dreams. Firstly, as to the <em>classification of dreams</em>; I
do not wish to overestimate either the practical or theoretical
significance of this question. I investigate yearly some 1500-2000
dreams, and this experience enables me to state that
typical dreams actually do exist. But they are not very
frequent, and from the view-point of finality they lose much
of the importance which attaches to them as a result of
the fixed significance of symbols according to the causal
view-point. It seems to me that the <em>typical themes</em> of
dreams are of far greater importance, for they permit of
a comparison with the themes of mythology. Many of
these mythological themes&mdash;in the study of which Frobenius
has rendered notable service&mdash;are also found in dreams,
often with precisely the same significance. Unfortunately
the limited time at my disposal, does not permit me to
lay detailed materials before you: this has been done
elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> But I desire to emphasise the fact that the
comparison of the typical themes of dreams with those of
mythology obviously suggests the idea (already put forward
by Nietzsche) that from a phylogenetic point of view dream-thought
should be conceived as an older form of thought.
Instead of multiplying examples in explanation of my
meaning, I will briefly refer you to our specimen dream.
As you remember, that dream introduced the apple scene
as a typical representation of erotic guilt. The gist of its
purport is: "I am doing wrong in acting like this." But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
it is characteristic that a dream never expresses itself in a
logically abstract way, but always in the language of parable
or simile. This peculiarity is also a characteristic feature
of primitive languages, whose flowery idioms always strike
us. If you call to mind the writings of ancient literature&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
the language of simile in the Bible&mdash;you will find that
what nowadays is expressed by means of abstract expressions,
could then only be expressed by means of simile. Even such
a philosopher as Plato did not disdain to express certain
fundamental ideas by means of concrete simile.</p>

<p>Just as the body bears traces of its phylogenetic development,
so also does the human mind. There is therefore
nothing surprising in the possibility of the allegories of our
dreams being a survival of archaic modes of thought.</p>

<p>The theft of the apple in our example is a typical theme
of dreams, often recurring with various modifications. It
is also a well-known theme in mythology, and is found not
only in the story of the Garden of Eden, but in numerous
myths and fables of all ages and climes. It is one of
those universally human symbols, which can reappear in
any one, at any time. Thus, dream psychology opens up
a way to a general comparative psychology, from which
we hope to attain the same sort of understanding of the
development and structure of the human soul, as comparative

<p class="p3">THE CONTENT OF THE PSYCHOSES<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Introduction</span></p>

<p>My short sketch on the Content of the Psychoses which first
appeared in the series of "Schriften zur Angewandten Seelenkunde"
under Freud's editorship was designed to give the
non-professional but interested public some insight into the
psychological point of view of recent psychiatry. I chose
by way of example a case of the mental disorder known as
Dementia Præcox, which Bleuler calls Schizophrenia. Statistically
this extensive group contains by far the largest
number of cases of psychosis. Many psychiatrists would
prefer to limit it, and accordingly make use of other nomenclature
and classification. From the psychological standpoint
the change of name is unimportant, for it is of less
value to know what a thing is called than to know what it is.
The cases of mental disorder sketched in this essay belong to
well-known and frequently occurring types, familiar to the
alienist. The facts will not be altered if these disorders are
called by some other name than dementia præcox.</p>

<p>I have presented my view of the psychological basis in a
work<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> whose scientific validity has been contested upon all
sorts of grounds. For me it is sufficient justification that a
psychiatrist of Bleuler's standing has fully accepted, in his
great monograph on the disease, all the essential points in
my work. The difference between us is as to the question
whether, in relation to the anatomical basis, the psychological
disorders should be regarded as primary or secondary. The
resolution of this weighty question depends upon the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>problem as to whether the prevailing dogma in psychiatry&mdash;"disorders
of the mind are disorders of the brain"&mdash;presents
a final truth or not. This dogma leads to absolute sterility
as soon as universal validity is ascribed to it. There are undoubted
psychogenic mental diseases (the so-called hysterical)
which are properly regarded as <em>functional</em> in contrast with
organic diseases which rest upon demonstrable anatomical
changes. Disorders of the brain should only be called
organic when the psychic symptoms depend upon an undoubtedly
primary disease of the brain. Now in dementia
præcox this is by no means a settled question. Definite
anatomical changes are present, but we are very far from
being able to relate the psychological symptoms to these
changes. We have, at least, positive information as to the
functional nature of early schizophrenic conditions; moreover
the organic character of paranoia and many paranoid
forms is still in great uncertainty. This being so it is worth
while to inquire whether manifestations of degeneration could
not also be provoked by psychological disturbance of function.
Such an idea is only incomprehensible to those who
smuggle materialistic preconceptions into their scientific
theories. This question does not even rest upon some fundamental
and arbitrary spiritualism, but upon the following
simple reflection. Instead of assuming that some hereditary
disposition, or a toxæmia, gives rise directly to organic processes
of disease, I incline to the view that upon the basis of
predisposition, whose nature is at present unknown to us,
there arises a non-adaptable psychological function which
can proceed to develop into manifest mental disorder; this
may secondarily determine organic degeneration with its
own train of symptoms. In favour of this conception is the
fact that we have no proof of the primary nature of the
organic disorder, but overwhelming proofs exist of a primary
psychological fault in function, whose history can be traced
back to the patient's childhood. In perfect agreement with
this conception is the fact that analytic practice has given
us experience of cases where patients on the borderline of
dementia præcox have been brought back to normal life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Even if anatomical lesions or organic symptoms were
constantly present, science ought not to imagine the psychological
standpoint could advisedly be neglected, or the undoubted
psychological relationship be given up as unimportant.
If, for instance, carcinoma were to prove an infectious disease
the peculiar growth and degenerative process of carcinomatous
cells would still be a constant factor requiring investigation
on its own account. But, as I have said, the correlation
between the anatomical findings and the psychological
picture of the disease is so loose that it is extremely desirable
to study the psychological side of it thoroughly.</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Part I</span></p>

<p>Psychiatry is the stepchild of medicine. All the other
branches of medicine have one great advantage over it&mdash;the
scientific methods can be applied; there are things to be
seen, and felt, physical and chemical methods of investigation
to be followed: the microscope shows the dreaded bacillus,
the surgeon's knife halts at no difficulty and gives us glimpses
of most inaccessible organs of vital importance. Psychiatry,
which engages in the exploration of the mind, stands ever at
the door seeking in vain to weigh and measure as in the
other departments of science. We have long known that we
have to do with a definite organ, the brain; but only beyond
the brain, beyond the morphological basis do we reach what
is important for us&mdash;the mind; as indefinable as it ever was,
still eluding any explanation, no matter how ingenious.
Former ages, endowing the mind with substance, and personifying
every incomprehensible occurrence in nature, regarded
mental disorder as the work of evil spirits; the patient was
looked upon as one possessed, and the methods of treatment
were such as fitted this conception. This mediæval conception
occasionally gains credence and expression even to-day.
A classical example is the driving out of the devil which the
elder Pastor Blumhardt carried out successfully in the famous
case of Gottlieb in Deltus.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> To the honour of the Middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Ages let it also be said that there are to be found early
evidences of a sound rationalism. In the sixteenth century
at the Julius Hospital in Würzburg mental patients were
already treated side by side with others physically ill, and
the treatment seems to have been really humane. With the
opening of the modern era, and with the dawn of the first
scientific ideas, the original barbaric personification of the
unknown Great Power gradually disappeared. A change
arose in the conception of mental disease in favour of a more
philosophic moral attitude. The old view that every misfortune
was the revenge of the offended gods returned new-clothed
to fit the times. Just as physical diseases can, in
many cases, be regarded as self-inflicted on account of
negligence, mental diseases were likewise considered to be
due to some moral injury, or sin. Behind this conception
the angry godhead also stood. Such views played a great
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i>, right up to the beginning of last century, especially in
Germany. In France, however, about the same time a new
idea was appearing, destined to sway psychiatry for a hundred
years. Pinel, whose statue fittingly stands at the gateway of
the Salpetrière in Paris, took away the chains from the
insane and thus freed them from the symbol of the criminal.
In a very real way he formulated for the world the humane
and scientific conception of modern times. A little later
Esquirol and Bayle discovered that certain forms of insanity
ended in death, after a relatively short time, and that certain
constant changes in the brain could be demonstrated <em>post
mortem</em>. Esquirol had described as an entity general
paralysis of the insane, or as it was popularly called "softening
of the brain," a disease which is always bound up with
chronic inflammatory degeneration of the cerebral matter.
Thus was laid the foundation of the dogma which you will
find repeated in every text-book of psychiatry, viz. "diseases
of the mind are diseases of the brain." Confirmation of this
conception was added about the same time by Gall's discoveries
which traced partial or complete loss of the power of
speech&mdash;a psychical capacity&mdash;to a lesion in the region of the
left lower frontal convolution. Somewhat later this view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
proved to be of general applicability. Innumerable cases of
extreme idiocy or other intense mental disorders were found
to be caused by tumours of the brain. Towards the end of
the nineteenth century Wernicke (recently deceased) localised
the speech centre in the left temporal lobe. This epoch-making
discovery raised hopes to the highest pitch. It was
expected that at no distant day every characteristic and
every psychical activity would be assigned a place in the
cortical grey matter. Gradually, increased attempts were
made to trace the primary mental changes in the psychoses
back to certain parallel changes in the brain. Meynert, the
famous Viennese psychiatrist, described a formal scheme in
which the alteration in blood-supply in certain regions was
to play the chief part in the origin of the psychoses.
Wernicke made a similar but far more ingenious attempt
at a morphological explanation of psychical disorders. The
visible result of this tendency is seen in the fact that even
the smallest and least renowned asylum has, to-day, its
anatomical laboratory where cerebral sections are cut, stained,
and microscoped. Our numerous psychiatric journals are full
of morphological contributions, investigations into the structure
and distribution of cells in the cortex, and other varying
source of disorders in the different mental diseases.</p>

<p>Psychiatry has come into fame as gross materialism.
And quite rightly, for it is on the road&mdash;or rather reached
it long ago&mdash;to put the organ, the instrument, above function.
Function has become the dependent accessory of its organs,
the mind the dependent accessory of the brain. In modern
mental therapy the mind has been the loser, whilst great
progress has been made in cerebral anatomy; of the mind we
know less than nothing. Current psychiatry behaves like a
man who thinks he can unriddle the meaning and importance
of a building by a mineralogical investigation of its stones.
Let us attempt to realise in which mental diseases obvious
changes in the brain are found, and what is their proportion.</p>

<p>In the last four years we have received 1325 patients at
Burgholzi;<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> 331 a year. Of these 9 per cent. suffered from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
congenital psychic anomalies. By this is understood a certain
inborn defect of the psyche. Of these 9 per cent., about
a quarter were imbeciles. Here we meet certain changes in
the brain such as microcephalus, hydrocephalus, malformations
or absence of portions of the brain. The remaining
three-quarters of these congenital defects present no typical
changes in the brain.</p>

<p>Three per cent. of our patients suffer from epileptic
mental troubles. In the course of epilepsy there arises
gradually a typical degeneration of the brain. The degeneration
is, however, only discoverable in severe cases and when
the disease has existed for some time. If the attacks have
only existed for a relatively short time, not more than a few
years, the brain as a rule shows nothing. Seventeen per
cent. of our patients suffer from progressive paralysis and
senile dementia. Both diseases present characteristic
changes in the brain. In paralysis there is most extensive
shrinkage of the brain, so that the cortex is often reduced by
one half. The frontal portions of the brain more especially,
may be reduced to a third of the normal weight. There is
a similar destruction of substance in senile decay.</p>

<p>Fourteen per cent. of the patients annually received are
cases of poisoning, at least 13 per cent. of these being due to
alcohol. As a rule in slight cases nothing is to be found in
the brain; in only a relatively few severe cases is there
shrinkage of the cortex, generally of slight degree. The
number of these severe cases amounts to less than 1 per
cent. of the yearly cases of alcoholism.</p>

<p>Six per cent. of the patients suffer from so-called maniacal
depressive insanity which includes the maniacs and the
melancholics. The essence of this disease is readily intelligible
to the public. Melancholia is a condition of abnormal
sadness without disorder of intelligence or memory. Mania
is the opposite, the rule being an abnormally excited state
with great restlessness; likewise without deep disturbance
of intelligence and memory. In this disease there are no
demonstrable morphological changes in the brain.</p>

<p>Forty-five per cent. of the patients suffer from the real and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
common mental disease called dementia præcox. The name
is a very unhappy one, for the dementia is not always precocious,
nor in all cases is there dementia. Unfortunately
the disease is too often incurable; even in the best cases, in
those that recover, where the outside public would not observe
any abnormality, there is always present some defect
in the emotional life. The picture presented by the disease
is extraordinarily diverse; generally there is some
disorder of feeling, frequently delusions and hallucinations.
As a rule there is nothing to be found in the brain. Even in
cases of a most severe type, lasting for years, an intact brain
is not infrequently found <em>post mortem</em>. In a few cases only
certain slight changes are present which, however, cannot as
yet be reduced to any law.</p>

<p>To sum up: in round figures a quarter of our insane
patients show more or less clearly extensive changes and
destruction of the brain, while three-fourths have a brain
which seems to be generally unimpaired or at most exhibit
such changes as give no explanation of the psychological
disturbance.</p>

<p>These figures offer the best possible proof that the purely
morphological view-point of modern psychiatry leads only
very indirectly, if at all, to the understanding of the mental
disorder, which is our aim. We must take into account the
fact that those mental diseases which show the most marked
disturbances of the brain end in death; for this reason the
chronic inmates of the asylum form its real population, consisting
of some 70 to 80 per cent. of cases of dementia præcox,
that is, of patients in whom anatomical changes are practically
non-existent. The psychiatry of the future must come
to grips with the core of the thing; the path is thus made
clear&mdash;<em>it can only be by way of psychology</em>. Hence in our
Zürich clinic we have entirely discarded the anatomical view
and turned to the psychological investigation of insanity. As
most of our patients suffer from dementia præcox we were
naturally concerned with this as our chief problem.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The older asylum physicians paid great attention to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
psychological precursors of mental disorder, just as the public
still does, following a true instinct. We accepted this hint
and carefully investigated the previous psychological history
wherever possible. Our trouble was richly rewarded, for we
often found, to our surprise, that the disease broke out at
a moment of some great emotion which, in its turn, had
arisen in a so-called normal way. We found, moreover, that
in the mental disease which ensued a number of symptoms
occurred which it was quite labour in vain to study from the
morphological standpoint. These same symptoms, however,
were comprehensible when considered from the standpoint
of the individual's previous history. Freud's fundamental
investigations into the psychology of hysteria and dreams
afforded us the greatest stimulus and help in our work.</p>

<p>A few instances of the latest method in psychiatry will
make the subject clearer than mere dry theory. In order to
bring home to you the difference in our conception I will
first describe the medical history in the older fashion, and
subsequently give the solution characteristic of the new
departure.</p>

<p>The case to be considered is that of a cook aged 32;
she had no hereditary taint, was always industrious and
conscientious, and had never been noticeable for eccentric
behaviour or the like. Quite recently she became acquainted
with a young man whom she wished to marry. From that
time on she began to show certain peculiarities. She often
spoke of his not liking her much, was frequently out of
sorts, ill-tempered, and sat alone brooding; once she ornamented
her Sunday hat very strikingly with red and green
feathers, another day she bought a pair of pince-nez in
order to wear them when she went out walking with her
fiancé. One day the sudden idea that her teeth were
rather ugly would not let her rest, and she resolved to get a
plate, although there was no absolute need. She had all
her teeth out under an anæsthetic. The night after the
operation she suddenly had a severe anxiety-attack. She
cried and moaned that she was damned for ever, for she
had committed a great sin; she should not have allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
her teeth to be extracted. People must pray for her, that
God might pardon her sin. In vain her friends attempted
to talk her out of her fears, to assure her that the extraction
of teeth was really no sin; it availed nothing. At day-break
she became somewhat quieter; she worked throughout
the day. On following nights the attacks were repeated.
When consulted by the patient I found her quiet, but she wore
a rather vacant expression. I talked to her about the operation,
and she assured me it was not so dreadful to have teeth
extracted, but still it was a great sin, from which position,
despite every persuasion, she could not be moved. She continually
repeated in plaintive, pathetic tones, "I should not
have allowed my teeth to be extracted; oh yes, that was
a great sin which God will never forgive me." She gave
the impression of real insanity. A few days later her condition
grew worse, and she had to be brought into the asylum.
The anxiety-attack had extended and was persistent, and the
mental disorder lasted for months.</p>

<p>The history shows a series of entirely unrelated symptoms.
Why all the queer story of the hat and pince-nez? Why
those anxiety-attacks? Why this delusion that the extraction
of her teeth was an unpardonable sin? Nothing here
is clear. The morphologically-minded psychiatrist would
say: This is just a typical case of dementia præcox; it is
the essence of insanity, of madness, to talk of nothing but
mysteries; the standpoint of the diseased mind towards the
world is displaced, is "mad." What is no sin for the normal,
the patient finds a sin. It is a bizarre delusion characteristic
of dementia præcox. The extravagant lamentation
about this supposed sin is what is known as "inadequate"<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
emotional emphasis. The queer ornamentation of the hat,
the pince-nez, are bizarre notions such as are very common
in these patients. Somewhere in the brain certain cells
have fallen into disorder, and manufacture illogical, senseless
ideas of one kind and another which are quite without
psychological meaning. The patient is obviously a hereditary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
degenerate with a weak brain, having a kink which is
the origin of the disorder. For some reason or other the
disease has suddenly broken out. It could just as easily
have broken out at any other time. Perhaps we should
have had to capitulate to these arguments had real psychological
analysis not come to our aid. In filling up the certificate
required for her removal to the asylum, it transpired
that many years ago she had had an affair which terminated;
her lover left her with an illegitimate child. Nobody
had been told of this. When she was again in love a dilemma
arose, and she asked herself, What will this new lover say
about it? At first she postponed the marriage, becoming more
and more worried, and then the eccentricities began. To
understand these we must immerse ourselves in the psychology
of a naïve soul. If we have to disclose some painful
secret to a beloved person we try first to strengthen his love
in order to obtain beforehand a guarantee of his forgiveness.
We do it by flattery or by caresses, or we try to impress
the value of our own personality in order to raise it in the
eyes of the other. Our patient decked herself out with
beautiful feathers, which to her simple taste seemed precious.
The wearing of "pince-nez" increases the respect of children
even of a mature age. And who does not know people who
will have their teeth extracted, out of pure vanity, in order
that they may wear a plate to improve their appearance?</p>

<p>After such an operation most people have a slight, nervous
reaction, and then everything becomes more difficult to bear.
This was, as a matter of fact, just the moment when the
catastrophe did occur, in her terror lest her fiancé should
break with her when he heard of her previous life. That was
the first anxiety-attack. Just as the patient had not acknowledged
her secret in all these years, so she now sought to
guard it, and shifted the fear in her guilty conscience on to
the extraction of the teeth; she thus followed a method well
known to us, for when we dare not acknowledge some great
sin we deplore some small sin with the greater emphasis.</p>

<p>The problem seemed insoluble to the weak and sensitive
mind of the patient, hence the affect became insurmountably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
great; this is the mental desire as presented from the
psychological side. The series of apparently meaningless
events, the so-called madness, have now a meaning; a significance
appertains to the delusions, making the patient more
human to us. Here is a person like ourselves, beset by
universal human problems, no longer merely a cerebral
machine thrown out of gear. Hitherto we thought that the
insane patient revealed nothing to us by symptoms, save the
senseless products of his disordered cerebral cells, but that
was academic wisdom reeking of the study. When we penetrate
into the human secrets of our patients, we recognise mental
disease to be an unusual reaction to emotional problems
which are in no wise foreign to ourselves, and the delusion
discloses the psychological system upon which it is based.</p>

<p>The light which shines forth from this conception seems
to us so enormously powerful because it forces us into the
innermost depths of that tremendous disorder which is most
common in our asylums, and hitherto least understood; by
reason of the craziness of the symptoms it is the type that
strikes the public as madness <em>in excelsis</em>.</p>

<p>The case which I have just sketched is a simple one. It
is transparent. My second example is somewhat more complicated.
It is the case of a man between 30 and 40 years
of age; he is a foreign archæologist of great learning and
most unusual intelligence. He was a precocious boy of quite
excellent character, great sensitiveness and rare gifts. Physically
he was small, always weakly, and a stammerer. He
grew up and was educated abroad, and afterwards studied
for several terms at B&mdash;&mdash;. So far there had been no disorder
of any kind. On the completion of his university
career he became zealously absorbed in his archæological
work, which gradually engulfed him to such an extent that
he was dead to the world and all its pleasures. He worked
incessantly, and buried himself entirely in his books. He
became quite unsociable; before, awkward and shy in society,
he now fled from it altogether, and saw no one beyond a few
friends. He thus led the life of a hermit devoted entirely to
science. A few years later, on a holiday tour, he revisited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
B&mdash;&mdash;, where he remained a few days. He walked a great
deal in the environs of the town. His few acquaintances now
found him somewhat strange, taciturn, and nervous. After
a somewhat protracted walk he seemed tired, and said that
he did not feel very well. He then remarked he must get
himself hypnotised, he felt his nerves unsteady. On top
of this he was attacked by physical illness, viz. inflammation
of the lungs. Very soon a peculiar state of excitement
supervened which led to suicidal ideas. He was
brought to the asylum, where for weeks he remained in an
extremely excited state. He was completely deranged, and
did not know where he was; he spoke in broken sentences
which no one could understand. He was often so excited
and aggressive that it took several attendants to hold him.
He gradually became quieter, and one day came to himself,
as if waking out of a long, confused dream. He soon completely
regained his health, and was discharged as cured.
He returned to his home and again immersed himself in
books. In the following years he published several remarkable
works, but, as before, his life was that of a hermit
living entirely in his books and dead to the world. He then
gradually acquired the name of a dried-up misanthrope,
lost to all meaning of the beauty of life. A few years after
his first illness a brief holiday brought him again to B&mdash;&mdash;.
As before he took his solitary walks in the environs. One day
he was suddenly overcome by a faint feeling, and lay down
in the street. He was carried into a neighbouring house
where he immediately became extremely excited. He began
to perform gymnastics, jumped over the rails of the bed,
turned somersaults in the room, began to declaim in a loud,
voice, sang his own improvisations, etc. He was again
brought to the asylum. The excitement continued. He
extolled his wonderful muscles, his beautiful figure, his
enormous strength. He believed that he had discovered a
natural law by which a wonderful voice could be developed.
He regarded himself as a great singer, and a marvellous
reciter, and at the same time he was a great inspired poet and
composer to whom verse and melody came spontaneously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>All this was in pitiable and very remarkable contrast to
reality. He is a small weakly man of unimposing build, with
poorly developed muscles betraying at the first glance the
atrophying effect of his studious life. He is unmusical, his
voice is weak and he sings out of tune; he is a bad speaker,
because of his stutter. For weeks he occupied himself in
the asylum with peculiar jumping, and contortions of the
body which he called gymnastics, he sang and declaimed.
Then he became more quiet and dreamy, often stared thoughtfully
in front of him for a long time, now and then sang
a love song which, despite its want of musical expression,
betrayed a pretty feeling for love's aspirations. This also
was in complete contrast with the dryness and isolation of
his normal life. He gradually became accessible for lengthy
conversations.</p>

<p>We will break off the history of the disease here, and sum
up what is furnished so far by observation of the patient.</p>

<p>In the first illness the delirium broke out unexpectedly,
and was followed by a mental disorder with confused ideas
and violence which lasted for several weeks. Complete
recovery appeared to have taken place. Six years later
there was a sudden outbreak of mania, grandiose delusions,
bizarre actions, followed by a twilight-stage gradually leading
to recovery. Here we again see a typical case of dementia
præcox, of the katatonic variety, especially characterised by
peculiar movements and actions. In psychiatry the views
obtaining at present would regard this as localised cellular
disease of some part of the cortex, exhibiting confusional
states, delusions of grandeur, peculiar contortions of the
muscles, or twilight-states, which taken all together have as
little psychological meaning as the bizarre shapes of a drop
of lead thrown into water.</p>

<p>This is not my view. It was certainly no accidental freak
of the brain-cells that created the dramatic contrasts shown in
the second illness. We can see that these contrasts, the so-called
grandiose delusions, were very subtly determined by the
deficiencies in the patient's personality. Without doubt, any
one of us would naturally regard these deficiencies seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
in ourselves. Who would not have the desire to find compensation
for the aridness of his profession and of his life
in the joys of poetry and music and to restore to his body
the natural power and beauty stolen from it by the study's
atmosphere? Do we not recall with envy the energy of a
Demosthenes who, despite his stammering, became a great
orator? If our patient thus fulfilled the obvious gaps in his
physical and mental life by delusional wishes, the supposition
is warranted that the whispered love-song which he sang
from time to time filled up a painful blank in his being,
which became more painful the more it was concealed. The
explanation is not far to seek. It is simply the old story,
born anew in every human soul, in a guise befitting the
destined creature's highest sensibilities.</p>

<p>When our patient was a student he learnt to know and
love a girl-student. Together they made many excursions in
the environs of the town, but his exceeding timidity and
bashfulness (the lot of the stammerer) never permitted him
an opportunity of getting out the appropriate words. Moreover,
he was poor and had nothing to offer her but hopes.
The time came for the termination of his studies; she went
away, and he also, and they never saw one another again.
And not long afterwards he heard she had married some
one else. Then he relinquished his hopes, but he did not
know that Eros never emancipates his slaves.</p>

<p>He buried himself in abstract learning, not to forget, but
to work for her in his thoughts. He wanted to keep the love
in his heart quite secret, and never to betray that secret.
He would dedicate his works to her without her ever knowing
it. The compromise succeeded, but not for long. Once he
travelled through the town where he heard she lived&mdash;it
seems to have been an accident that he travelled through
that town. He did not leave the train, which only made a
short halt there. From the window he saw standing in the
distance a young woman with a little child, and thought it
was she. Impossible to say whether it was really so or not.
He does not think he felt any peculiar feeling at that moment;
anyway he gave himself no trouble to ascertain whether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
was she, which makes the presumption strong that it was
not really she. The unconscious wanted to be left in peace
with its illusion. Shortly afterwards he again came to B&mdash;&mdash;,
the place of old memories. Then he felt something strange
stir in his soul, an uneasy feeling, akin to Nietzsche's&mdash;</p>

<p>Civilised man no longer believes in demons, he calls
in the doctor. Our patient wanted to be hypnotised. Then
madness overcame him. What was going on in him?</p>

<p>He answered this question in broken sentences, with long
pauses, in that twilight-stage that heralds convalescence. I
give as faithfully as may be his own words. When he fell ill
he suddenly lost the well-regulated world and found himself
in the chaos of an overmastering dream, a sea of blood and
fire; the world was out of joint; everywhere conflagration,
volcanic outbreaks, earthquakes, mountains fell in, followed
by enormous battles where the peoples fell upon one another;
he became involved more and more in the battle of nature, he
was right in the midst of those fighting, wrestling, defending
himself, enduring unutterable misery and pain; gradually he
was exalted and strengthened by a strange calming feeling
that some one was watching his struggles, that his loved one
saw all from afar. That was the time when he showed real
violence to the attendants. He felt his strength increasing
and saw himself at the head of great armies which he would
lead to victory. Then more great battles and at length
victory. He would try to get his loved one as prize of victory.
As he drew near her the illness ceased, and he awoke from
a long dream.</p>

<p>His daily life again began to follow the regular routine.
He shut himself up in his work and forgot the abyss within
himself. A few years later he is again at B&mdash;&mdash; Demon or
Destiny? Again he followed the old trail and again was
overborne by old memories. But this time he was not immersed
in the depths of confusion. He remained orientated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en rapport</i> with his surroundings. The struggle was
considerably milder, but he did gymnastics, practised the
arts, and made good his deficiencies; then followed the dreamy
stage with the love-songs, corresponding to the period of
victory in the first psychosis. In this state, according to his
own words, he had a dreamlike feeling as if he stood upon
the borders of two worlds and knew not whether truth stood
on the right or on the left. He told me, "It is said she is
married, but I believe she is not, but is still waiting for me;
I feel that it must be so. It is ever to me as if she were not
married, and as if success were yet attainable."</p>

<p>Our patient here portrayed but a pale copy of the scene in
the first attack of psychosis, when he, the victor, stood before
his mistress. In the course of a few weeks after this conversation
the scientific interests of the patient again began to
predominate. He spoke with obvious unwillingness about
his intimate life, he repressed it more and more, and finally
turned away from it as if it did not belong to himself. Thus
gradually the gate of the under-world became closed. There
remained nothing but a certain tense expression, and a look
which, though fixed on the outer world, was turned inwards at
the same time; and this alone hinted at the silent activity of
the unconscious, preparing new solutions for his insoluble
problem. This is the so-called cure in dementia præcox.</p>

<p>Hitherto we psychiatrists used not to be able to suppress
a laugh when we read an artist's attempts to portray a
psychosis. These attempts have been generally regarded as
quite useless, for the writer introduces into his conception of
the psychosis psychological relationships quite foreign to the
clinical picture of the disease. But the artist has not simply
proceeded to copy a case out of a psychiatric text-book; he
knows as a rule better than the psychiatrist.</p>

<p>The case which I have sketched is not unique, it is typical
of a whole class for which the artist Spitteler has created
a model of universal validity; the model is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Imago</i>. I may
take for granted that you know his book of that name. The
psychological gulf, however, between the creation of the artist
and the insane person is great. The world of the artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
is one of solved problems; the world of reality, that of unsolved
problems. The mental patient is a faithful image
of this reality. His solutions are unsatisfying illusions, his
cure a temporary giving up of the problem, which yet goes on
working in the depths of the unconscious, and at the appointed
time again rises to the surface and creates new illusions with
new scenery; part of the history of mankind is here seen
abridged.</p>

<p>Psychological analysis is far from being able to explain
in complete and illuminating fashion all cases of the disease
with which we are here concerned. On the contrary, the
majority remain obscure and difficult to understand, and
chiefly because only a certain proportion of patients recover.
Our last patient is noteworthy because his return to a normal
state afforded us a survey of the period of his illness. Unfortunately
the advantage of this standpoint is not always
possible to us, for a great number of persons never find
their way back from their dreams. They are lost in the
maze of a magic garden where the same old story is repeated
again and again in a timeless present. For patients
the hands of the clock of the world remain stationary; there
is no time, no further development. It makes no difference
to them whether they dream for two days or thirty years. I
had a patient in my ward who was five years without uttering
a word, in bed, and entirely buried in himself. For years I
visited him twice daily, and as I reached his bedside I could
see at once that there was no change. One day I was just
about to leave the room when a voice I did not recognise
called out&mdash;"Who are you? What do you want here?" I
saw with astonishment that it was the dumb patient who had
suddenly regained his voice, and obviously his senses also. I
told him I was his doctor, whereupon he asked angrily, why
was he kept a prisoner here, and why did no one ever speak
to him? He said this in an injured voice just like a normal
person whom one had neglected for a couple of days. I
informed him that he had been in bed quite speechless for
five years and had responded to nothing, whereat he looked
at me fixedly and without understanding. Naturally I tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
to discover what had gone on in him during these five years,
but could learn nothing. Another patient with a similar
symptom, when asked why he had remained silent for years,
maintained, "Because I wanted to spare the German
language."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> These examples show that it is often impossible
to lift the veil of the secret, for the patients themselves
have neither interest nor pleasure in explaining their strange
experiences, in which as a rule they realise nothing peculiar.</p>

<p>Occasionally the symptoms themselves are a sign-post to
the understanding of the psychology of the disease.</p>

<p>We had a patient who was for thirty-five years an inmate
at Burghölzli. For decades she lay in bed, she never spoke
or reacted to anything, her head was always bowed, her
back bent and the knees somewhat drawn up. She was
always making peculiar rubbing movements with her hands,
so as to give rise during the course of years to thick horny
patches on her hands. She kept the thumb and index finger
of her right hand together as in the movement of sewing.
When she died I tried to discover what she had been formerly.
Nobody in the asylum recalled ever having seen her out of
bed. Only our chief attendant had a memory of having seen
her sitting in the same attitude as that she afterwards took
up in bed, at which time she was making rapid movements
of extension of the arm across the right knee; it was said
of her that she was sewing shoes, later that she was polishing
shoes. As time went on the movements became more
limited till finally there remained but a slight rubbing movement,
and only the finger and thumb retained the sewing
position. In vain I consulted our old attendant, she knew
nothing about the patient's previous history. When the
seventy-year-old brother came to the funeral I asked him
what had been the cause of his sister's illness; he told me that
she had had a love-affair, but for various reasons it had come
to nothing. The girl had taken this so to heart that she
became low-spirited. In answer to a query about her lover
it was found that he was a <em>shoemaker</em>.</p>

<p>Unless you see here some strange play of accident, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
must agree that the patient had kept the memory-picture of
her lover unaltered in her heart for thirty-five years.</p>

<p>One might easily think that these patients who give
an impression of imbecility are only burnt-out ruins of
humanity. But such is probably not the case. One can
often prove directly that such patients register everything
going on around them even with a certain curiosity, and
have an excellent memory for it all. This is the reason
why many patients become for a time pretty sensible again,
and develop mental powers which one believed they had
long since lost. Such intervals occur occasionally during
serious physical disease, or just before death. We had a
patient with whom it was impossible to carry on a sane
conversation; he only produced a mad medley of delusions
and words. He once fell seriously ill physically, and I expected
it would be very difficult to treat him. Not at all. He
was quite changed, he became friendly and amiable, and
carried out all his doctor's orders patiently and gratefully.
His eyes lost their evil darting looks, and shone quietly and
understandingly. One morning I came to his room with the
usual greeting: "Good morning. How are you getting
on?" The patient answered me in the well-known way:
"There again comes one of the dog and monkey troupe
wanting to play the Saviour." Then I knew his physical
trouble was over. From that moment the whole of his
reason was as if "blown away" again.</p>

<p>From these observations we see that reason still survives,
but is pushed away into some corner by the complete preoccupation
of the mind with diseased thoughts.</p>

<p>Why is the mind compelled to exhaust itself in the
elaboration of diseased nonsense? On this difficult question
our new insight throws considerable light. To-day we can say
that the pathological images dominate the interests of the
patient so completely, because they are simply derivatives of
the most important questions that used to occupy the person
when normal&mdash;what in insanity is now an incomprehensible
maze of symptoms used to be fields of vital interest to the
former personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>I will cite as an example a patient who was twenty years
in the asylum. She was always a puzzle to the physicians,
for the absurdity of her delusions exceeded anything that
the boldest imagination could create.</p>

<p>She was a dressmaker by trade, born in 1845, of very
poor family. Her sister early went wrong and was finally
lost in the swamp of prostitution. The patient herself led
an industrious, respectable, reserved life. She fell ill in
1886 in her 39th year&mdash;at the threshold of the age when so
many a dream is brought to naught. Her illness consisted
in delusions and hallucinations which increased rapidly, and
soon became so absurd that no one could understand her
wishes and complaints. In 1887 she came to the asylum.
In 1888 her statements, so far as the delusions were concerned,
were not intelligible. She maintained such monstrous
things as that: "At night her spinal marrow had
been torn out; pains in the back had been caused by substances
that went through the walls and were covered with
magnetism." "The monopoly fixed the sorrows which are
not in the body and do not fly about in the air." "Excursions
are made by breathing in chemistry, and by suffocation
regions are destroyed."</p>

<p>In 1892 the patient styled herself the "Bank Note
Monopoly, Queen of the Orphans, Proprietress of the
Burghölzli Asylum;" she said: "Naples and I must provide
the world with macaroni" (Nudel).</p>

<p>In 1896 she became "Germania and Helvetia from
exclusively pure butter"; she also said, "I am Noah's Ark,
the boat of salvation and respect."</p>

<p>Since then the disease has greatly increased; her last
creation is the delusion that she is the "lily red sea monster
and the blue one."</p>

<p>These instances will show you how far the incomprehensibility
of such pathological formations go. Our patient was
for years the classic example of meaningless delusional ideas
in dementia præcox; and many hundreds of medical students
have received from the demonstration of this case a permanent
impression of the sinister power of insanity. But even this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
case has not withstood the newer technique of psychoanalysis.
What the patient says is not at all meaningless; it is full of
significance, so that he who has the key can understand
without overmuch difficulty.</p>

<p>Time does not allow me to describe the technique by means
of which I succeeded in lifting the veil of her secret. I must
content myself by giving a few examples to make the strange
changes of thought and of speech in this patient clear to you.</p>

<p>She said of herself that <em>she was Socrates</em>. The analysis of
this delusion presented the following ideas: Socrates was the
wisest man, the man of greatest learning; he was infamously
accused, and had to die in prison at the hands of strange men.
She was the best dressmaker, but "never unnecessarily cut a
thread, and never allowed a piece of material to lie about on
the floor." She worked ceaselessly, and now she has been
falsely accused, wicked men have shut her up, and she will
have to die in the asylum.</p>

<p>Therefore she is Socrates; this is, as you see, simple
metaphor, based upon obvious analogy. Take another
example: "<em>I am the finest professor and the finest artist in the
world.</em>"</p>

<p>The analysis furnishes the remarks that she is the best
dressmaker and chooses the most beautiful models which
show up well and waste little material; she puts on the
trimming only where it can be seen. She is a professor, and
an artist in her work. She makes the best clothes and calls
them absurdly "The Schnecke Museum-clothes." Her
customers are only such persons as frequent the Schnecke
House and the Museum (the Schnecke House is the aristocratic
club. It is near the Museum and the Library, another
rendezvous of the aristocratic set of Zürich), for she is the
best dressmaker and makes only Schnecke Museum<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> clothing.</p>

<p>The patient also <em>calls herself Mary Stuart</em>. Analysis showed
the same analogy as with Socrates: innocent suffering and
death of a heroine.</p>

<p>"<em>I am the Lorelei.</em>" Analysis: This is an old and well-known
song: "I know not what it means," etc. Whenever she wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
to speak about her affairs people do not understand her, and
say they don't know what it means; hence she is the Lorelei.</p>

<p>"<em>I am Switzerland.</em>" Analysis: Switzerland is free, no
one can rob Switzerland of her freedom. The patient does
not belong to the asylum, she would be free like Switzerland,
hence she is Switzerland.</p>

<p>"<em>I am a crane.</em>" Analysis: In the "Cranes of Ibykus"
it is said: "Whosoever is free of sin and fault shall preserve
the pure soul of a child." She has been brought innocent to
the asylum and has never committed a crime&mdash;hence she is
a crane.</p>

<p>"<em>I am Schiller's Bell.</em>" Analysis: Schiller's Bell is the
greatest work of the great master. She is the best and most
industrious dressmaker, and has achieved the highest rung in
the art of dressmaking&mdash;hence she is Schiller's Bell.</p>

<p>"<em>I am Hufeland.</em>" Analysis: Hufeland was the best
doctor. She suffers intolerably in the asylum and is moreover
treated by the worst doctors. She is, however, so
prominent a personality that she had a claim to the best
doctors, that is to a doctor like Hufeland&mdash;hence she is
Hufeland.</p>

<p>The patient used the expression "I am" in a very arbitrary
way. Sometimes it meant "it belongs to me" or "it
is proper for me"; sometimes it means "I should have."
This is seen from the following analysis:</p>

<p>"<em>I am the master-key.</em>" Analysis: The master-key is the
key that opens all the doors of the asylum. Properly, according
to all rights, the patient should long since have obtained
this key for she has been for many years "the proprietress of
the Burghölzli Asylum." She expresses this reflection very
much simplified in the sentence, "I am the master-key."</p>

<p>The chief content of her delusions is concentrated in the
following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>I am the monopoly.</em>" Analysis: The patient means the
banknote monopoly, which has belonged to her for some time.
She believes that she possesses the monopoly of the entire
bank notes of the world, thus creating enormous riches for
herself, in compensation for the poverty and lowliness of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
lot. Her parents died early; hence she is the Queen of the
Orphans. Her parents lived and died in great poverty. Her
blessings are extended to them also, the dreamlike delusions
of the patient benefit them in many ways. She says textually:
"My parents are clothed by me, my sorely-tried mother,
full of sorrow&mdash;I sat with her at table&mdash;covered in white with
superfluity."</p>

<p>This is another of these malleable hallucinations which
the patient had daily. It is one of those scenes of wish-fulfilment,
with poverty on one side and riches on the other, recalling
Hauptmann's Hannele; more especially that scene
where Gottwald says: "She was clothed in rags&mdash;now she is
bedeckt in silken robes; and she ran about barefoot&mdash;now
she has shoes of glass to her feet. Soon she will live in a
golden castle and eat each day of baked meats. Here has she
lived on cold potatoes...."</p>

<p>The wish-fulfilments of our patient go even further.
Switzerland has to furnish her with an income of 150,000
francs. The Director of the Burghölzli owes her 80,000 francs
damages for wrongful incarceration. She is the proprietress
of a distant island with silver mines, the "mightiest silver
island in the world." Therefore she is also the greatest orator,
possesses the most wonderful eloquence, for, as she says,
"Speech is <em>silver</em>, silence gold." To her all the beautiful
landed estates belong&mdash;all the rich quarters, towns and lands,
she is the proprietress of a world, even a "threefold proprietress
of the world." Whilst poor Hannele was only elevated
to the side of the Heavenly Bridegroom, our patient has the
"Key of Heaven," she is not only the honoured earthly queens
Mary Stuart and Queen Louise of Prussia, but she is also the
Queen of Heaven, the Mother of God as well as the Godhead.
Even in this earthly world where she was but a poor, ill-regarded
homely dressmaker she attained fulfilments of her
human wishes, for she had taken three husbands from the
best families in the town and her fourth was the Emperor
Francis. From these marriages there were two phantom
children&mdash;a little boy and a little girl. Just as she clothed,
fed and feasted her parents, so she provided for the future of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
her children. To her son she bequeathed the great bazaar of
Zürich, therefore her son is a "Zur," for the proprietor of a
<em>Bazaar</em> is a "Zur." The daughter resembles her mother;
hence she becomes the proprietress of the asylum and takes
her mother's place so that the mother is released from captivity.
The daughter therefore receives the title of "Agency
of Socrates," for she replaces Socrates in captivity.</p>

<p>These instances by no means exhaust the delusional fancies
of the patient. But they will give you some idea, I hope, of
the richness of her inner life although she was apparently so
dull and apathetic, or, as was said <em>imbecile</em>, and sat for twenty
years in her workroom, where she mechanically repaired her
linen, occasionally uttering a complex of meaningless fragments
which no one had hitherto been able to understand.
Her odd lack of words can now be seen in another light; they
are fragments of enigmatical inscriptions, of fairy-story
phantasies, which have escaped from the hard world to found
a world of their own. Here the tables are ever laden, and a
thousand feasts are celebrated in golden palaces. The patient
can only spare a few mysterious symbols for the gloomy dim
shores of reality; they need not be understood, for our understanding
has not been necessary for her for this long time.</p>

<p>Nor is this patient at all unique. She is one of a type.
Similar phantasies are always found in patients of this kind,
though not always in such profusion.</p>

<p>The parallels with Hauptmann's Hannele show that here
likewise the artist has shown us the way with the free creation
of his own phantasy. From this coincidence, which is not
accidental, we may conclude that there is something common
both to the artist and the insane and not to them alone.
Every human being has also within himself that restless
creative phantasy which is ever engaged in assuaging the
harshness of reality. Whoever gives himself unsparingly
and carefully to self-observation, will realise that there dwells
within him something which would gladly hide and cover up
all that is difficult and questionable in life, and thus procure
an easy and free path. Insanity grants the upper hand to
this something. When once it is uppermost, reality is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
or less quickly driven out. It becomes a distant dream, and
the dream which enchains the patient wholly or in part, and
often for life, has now the attributes of reality. We normal
persons, who have to do entirely with reality, see only the
products of disordered fancy, but not the wealth of that side of
the mind which is turned away from us. Unfortunately only
too often no further knowledge reaches us of the things
which are transpiring on that other side, because all the
bridges are broken down which unite this side with that.</p>

<p>We do not know to-day whether these new views are of
universal or only of limited validity; the more carefully and
perseveringly we examine our patients, the more we shall
meet cases, which, despite apparent total imbecility, will yet
afford us at least some fragmentary insight into the obscurities
of the psychical life. This life is far removed from that mental
poverty which the prevailing theories were compelled to
accept.</p>

<p>However far we are from being able to understand fully
the concatenations of that obscure world, at least we may
maintain, with complete assurance, that in dementia præcox
there is no symptom which can be described as psychologically
baseless and meaningless. The most absurd things are in
reality symbols of ideas which are not only generally understandable,
but also universally operative in the human heart.
In insanity we do not discover anything new and unknown,
but we look at the foundation of our own being, the source
of those life-problems in which we are all engaged.</p>


<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Part II.</span><a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>The number of psychoanalytic investigations into the
psychology of dementia præcox has considerably increased
since the publication of my book upon the subject.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> When,
in 1903, I made the first analysis of a case of dementia præcox,
there dawned on me a premonition of the possibilities of
future discoveries in this sphere. This has been confirmed.</p>

<p>Freud first submitted a case of paranoid dementia to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>closer psychological investigation.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> This he was enabled to
do by means of an analytic technique perfected through his
rich experiences with neurotics. He selected the famous autobiography
of P. Schreber, "Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken."
The patient could not be analysed personally, but
having published his most interesting autobiography all the
material wanted for an analysis was to be found in it.</p>

<p>In this study Freud shows out of what infantile forms of
thought and instincts the delusional system was built up.
The peculiar delusions which the patient had about his doctor
whom he identified with God or with a god-like being, and
certain other surprising and really blasphemous ideas, Freud
was able to reduce most ingeniously to his infantile relationship
to his father. This case also presented similar bizarre and
grotesque concatenations of ideas to the one I have described.
As the author himself says, his work confines itself to the
task of pointing out those universally existent and undifferentiated
foundations out of which we may say every psychological
formation is historically developed.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> This reductive analytical
process did not, however, furnish such enlightening results
in regard to the rich and surprising symbolism in patients of
this kind as we had been accustomed to expect from the same
method in the realm of the psychology of hysteria. In reading
certain works of the Zürich school, for example, Maeder,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
Spielrein,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Nelken,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Grebelskaja,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Itten,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> one is powerfully
impressed by the enormous symbol-formation in dementia
præcox.</p>

<p>Some of the authors still proceed essentially by the method
of analytic reduction, tracing back the complicated delusional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
formation into its simpler and more universal components,
as I have done in the preceding pages. One cannot, however,
resist the feeling that this method hardly does justice to the
fulness and the almost overpowering wealth of phantastic
symbol-formation, although it does undoubtedly throw a light
upon the subject in certain directions.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate with an example. We should be thankful
for a commentary upon "Faust" which traced back all the
diverse material of Part II. to its historical sources, or for
a psychological analysis of Part I. which pointed out how
the dramatic conflict corresponds to a personal conflict in
the soul of the poet; we should be glad of an exposition
which pointed out how this subjective conflict is itself based
upon those ultimate and universal human things which are
nowise foreign to us since we all carry the seeds of them in
our hearts. Nevertheless we should be a little disappointed.
We do not read "Faust" just in order to discover that also
we are, in all things, "human, all too human." Alas, we
know that but too well already. Let any one who has not yet
learnt it go for a little while out into the world and look
at it without preconceptions and with open eyes. He will
turn back from the might and power of the "too human,"
hungrily he will pick up his "Faust," not to find again
what he has just left, but to learn how a man like Goethe
shakes off these elemental human things and finds freedom
for his soul. When we once know who was the "Proktophantasmist,"
to what chronological events the mass of
symbols in Part II. relates, how it is all intimately bound up
with the poet's own soul and conditioned by it, we come to
regard this determination as less important than the problem
itself&mdash;what does the poet mean by his symbolic creation?
Proceeding purely reductively, one discovers the final meaning
in these universal human things; and demands nothing
further from an explanation than that the unknown and complicated
shall be reduced to the known and simple. I should
like to designate this kind of understanding as <em>retrospective
understanding</em>. But there is another kind of understanding,
which is not analytic reduction, but is of a <em>synthetic</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
or <em>constructive</em> nature. I would designate this <em>prospective
understanding</em>, and the corresponding method as the <cite>Constructive
method</cite>.</p>

<p>It is common knowledge that present-day scientific explanation
rests upon the basis of the causal principle. Scientific
explanation is causal explanation. We are therefore naturally
inclined, whenever we think scientifically, to explain causally,
to understand a thing and to regard it as explained whenever
it is reduced analytically to its cause and general principle.
In so far Freud's psychological method of interpretation is
strictly scientific.</p>

<p>If we apply this method to "Faust" it must become clear
that something more is required for a true understanding.
It will even seem to us that we have not gathered the poet's
deepest meaning if we only see in it universal foregone human
conclusions. What we really want to find out is how this man
has redeemed himself as an individual, and when we arrive
at this comprehension then we shall also understand the
symbol given by Goethe. It is true we may then fall into
the error that we understand Goethe himself. But let us be
cautious and modest, simply saying we have thereby arrived
at an understanding of ourselves. I am thinking here of
Kant's thought-compelling definition of comprehension, as
"the realisation of a thing to the extent which is sufficient
for our purpose."</p>

<p>This understanding is, it is true, subjective, and therefore
not scientific for those to whom science and explanation by
the causal principle are identical. But the validity of this
identification is open to question. In the sphere of psychology
I must emphasise my doubt on this point.</p>

<p>We speak of "objective" understanding when we have
given a causal explanation. But at bottom, understanding is
a subjective process upon which we confer the quality "objective"
really only to differentiate it from another kind of understanding
which is also a psychological and subjective process,
but upon which, without further ado, we bestow the quality
"subjective." The attitude of to-day only grants scientific
value to "objective" understanding on account of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
universal validity. This standpoint is incontestably correct
wherever it is not a question of the psychological process
itself, and hence it is valid in all sciences apart from pure
psychology.</p>

<p>To interpret Faust objectively, <i>i.e.</i> from the causal standpoint,
is as though a man were to consider a sculpture from
the historical, technical and&mdash;last but not least&mdash;from the
mineralogical standpoint. But where lurks the <em>real meaning</em>
of the wondrous work? Where is the answer to that most
important question: what aim had the artist in mind, and how
are we ourselves to understand his work subjectively? To
the scientific spirit this seems an idle question which anyhow
has nothing to do with science. It comes furthermore into
collision with the causal principle, for it is a purely speculative
constructive view. And the modern world has overthrown
this spirit of scholasticism.</p>

<p>But if we would approach to an understanding of psychological
things we must remember the fact of the subjective
conditioning of all knowledge. The world is <em>as we see it</em> and
not simply objective; this holds true even more of the mind.
Of course it is possible to look at the mind objectively, just
as at Faust, or a Gothic Cathedral. In this objective conception
there is comprised the whole worth and worthlessness
of current experimental psychology and psychoanalysis.
The scientific mind, thinking causally, is incapable of understanding
what is ahead; it only understands what is past,
that is, retrospective. Like Ahriman, the Persian devil, it
has the gift of After-Knowledge. But this spirit is only one
half of a complete comprehension. The other more important
half is prospective or constructive; if we are not able to
understand what lies ahead, then nothing is understood. If
psychoanalysis, following Freud's orientation, should succeed
in presenting an uninterrupted and conclusive connection
between Goethe's infantile sexual development and his work,
or, following Adler, between the infantile struggle for power
and the adult Goethe and his work, an interesting proposition
would have been solved&mdash;we should have learnt how a masterpiece
can be reduced to the simplest thinkable elements, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
are universal, and to be found working within the depths of
everything and everybody. But did Goethe construct his
work to <em>this</em> end? Was it his intention that it should be
thus conceived?</p>

<p>It must be sufficiently clear that such an understanding,
though undoubtedly scientific, would be entirely, utterly,
beside the mark. This statement is valid for psychology in
general. To understand the psyche causally, means to understand
but half of it. The causal understanding of Faust
enlightens us as to how it became a finished work of art, but
reveals nothing of the living meaning of the poet. That
meaning only lives if we experience it, in and through ourselves.
In so far as our actual present life is for us something essentially
new and not a repetition of all that has gone before,
the great value of such a work is to be seen, not in its causal
development, but in its living reality for our own lives. We
should be indeed depreciating a work like Faust if we were
only to regard it as something that has been perfected and
finished; it is only understood when conceived as a becoming
and as an ever new-experiencing.</p>

<p>Thus we must regard the human psyche. Only on one
side is the mind a Has Been, and as such subordinate to the
causal principle. On the other side the mind is a Becoming
that can only be grasped synthetically or constructively. The
causal standpoint asks how it is this actual mind has become
what it appears to-day? The constructive standpoint asks
how a bridge can be built from this actual psyche to its own
future?</p>

<p>Just as the causal method finally reaches the general
principles of human psychology by the analysis and reduction
of individual events, so does the constructive standpoint reach
aims that are general by the synthesis of individual tendencies.
The mind is a point of passage and thus necessarily determined
from two sides. On the one side it offers a picture of the precipitate
of the past, and on the other side a picture of the
germinating knowledge of all that is to come, in so far as the
psyche creates its own future.</p>

<p>What has been is, on the one hand, the result and apex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
of all that was&mdash;as such it appears to the causal standpoint;
on the other hand, it is an expression of all that is to be.
The future is only <em>apparently</em> like the past, but in its essence
always new and unique, (the causal standpoint would like
to invert this sentence) thus the actual formula is incomplete,
germlike so to say, in relation to what is to be.</p>

<p>To get any conception of this expression of what is to be
we are forced to apply a constructive interest to it. I almost
felt myself tempted to say, "a scientific interest." But
modern science is identical with the causal principle. So long
as we consider the actual mind causally, that is scientifically,
we elude the mind as a Becoming. This other side of
the psyche can never be grasped by the exclusive use of the
causal principle, but only by means of the constructive
standpoint. The causal standpoint reduces things to their
elements, the constructive standpoint elaborates them into
something higher and more complicated. This latter standpoint
is necessarily a speculative one.</p>

<p>Constructive understanding is, however, differentiated from
scholastic speculation because it imposes no general validity,
but only subjective validity. When the speculative philosopher
believes he has comprehended the world once for all by his
System, he deceives himself; he has only comprehended himself
and then naïvely projected that view upon the world. In
reaction against this, the scientific method of the modern world
has almost put an end to speculation and gone to the other
extreme. It would create an "objective" psychology. In
opposition to such efforts, the stress which Freud has placed
upon individual psychology is of immortal merit. The extraordinary
importance of the subjective in the development of
the objective mental process was thus first brought adequately
into prominence.</p>

<p>Subjective speculation lays no claim to universal validity,
it is identical with constructive understanding. It is a subjective
creation, which, looked at externally, easily seems to
be a so-called infantile phantasy, or at least an unmistakable
derivative of it; from an objective standpoint it must be
judged as such, in so far as objective is regarded as identical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
with scientific or causal. Looked at from within, however,
constructive understanding means redemption.</p>

<p>"Creation&mdash;that is the great redemption from suffering
and easiness of living."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Starting from these considerations as to the psychology of
those mental patients to whom the Schreber case belongs, we
must, from the "objective-scientific" standpoint, reduce the
structural phantasy of the patient to its simple and most
generally valid elements. This Freud had done. But that
is only half of the work to be done. The other half is the constructive
understanding of Schreber's system. The question
is: What end, what freedom, did the patient hope to achieve
by the creation of his system?</p>

<p>The scientific thinker of to-day will regard this question
as inappropriate. The psychiatrist will certainly smile at it,
for he is thoroughly assured of the universal validity of his
causalism, he knows the psyche merely as something that is
made, descendent, reactive. Not uncommonly there lurks the
unconscious prejudice that the psyche is a brain-secretion.</p>

<p>Looking at such a morbid system without preconception,
and asking ourselves what goal this delusional system is
aiming at, we see, in fact, firstly, that it <em>is</em> endeavouring to
get at something, and secondly, that the patient also devotes
all his will-power to the service of the system. There are
patients who develop their delusions with scientific thoroughness,
often dragging in an immense material of comparison
and proof. Schreber certainly belongs to this class. Others
do not proceed so thoroughly and learnedly, but content themselves
with heaping up synonymous expressions for that at
which they are aiming. The case of the patient I have
described, who assumes all kinds of titles, is a good instance
of this.</p>

<p>The patient's unmistakable striving to express something
through and by means of his delusion Freud conceives retrospectively,
as the satisfaction of his infantile wishes by means
of imagination. Adler reduces it to the desire for power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>For him the delusion-formation is a "manly protest," a
means of gaining security for himself against his menaced
superiority. Thus characterised, this struggle is likewise
infantile and the means employed&mdash;the delusional creation&mdash;is
infantile because insufficient for its purpose; one can
therefore understand why Freud declines to accept Adler's
point of view. Freud, rightly on the whole, subsumes this
infantile struggle for power under the concept of the infantile
wish.</p>

<p>The constructive standpoint is different. Here the delusional
system is neither infantile nor, upon the whole, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">eo ipso</i>
pathological but <em>subjective</em>, and hence justified within the
scope of the subjective. The constructive standpoint absolutely
denies the conception that the subjective phantasy-creation
is merely an infantile wish, symbolically veiled; or
that it is merely that in a higher degree; it denies that it is
a convulsive and egoistic adhesion to the fiction of its own
superiority, in so far as these are to be regarded as finalistic
explanations. The subjective activity of the mind can be
judged from without, just as one can, in the end, so judge
everything. But this judgment is inadequate, because it is
the very essence of the subjective that it cannot be judged
objectively. We cannot measure distance in pints. The
subjective can be only understood and judged subjectively,
that is, constructively. Any other judgment is unfair and
does not meet the question.</p>

<p>The absolute credit which the constructive standpoint
confers upon the subjective, naturally seems to the "scientific"
spirit as an utter violation of reason. But this scientific
spirit can only take up arms against it so long as the
constructive is not avowedly <em>subjective</em>. The constructive comprehension
also <em>analyses</em>, but it does not <em>reduce</em>. It decomposes
the delusion into <em>typical</em> components. What is to be
regarded as the type at a given time is shown from the attainment
of experience and knowledge reached at that time.</p>

<p>Even the most individual delusional systems are not absolutely
unique, occurring only once, for they offer striking and
obvious analogies with other systems. From the comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
analysis of many systems the typical formations are
drawn. If one can speak of reduction at all, it is only a
question of reduction to general type, but not to some universal
principle obtained inductively or deductively, such as
"Sexuality" or "Struggle for Power." This paralleling
with other typical formations only serves for a widening of
the basis upon which the construction is to be built. If one
were to proceed entirely subjectively one would go on constructing
in the language of the patient and in his mental
range. One would arrive at some structure which was illuminating
to the patient and to the investigator of the case but
not to the outer scientific public. The public would be unable
to enter into the peculiarities of the speech and thought of
the individual case in question without further help.</p>

<p>The works of the Zürich school referred to contain careful
and detailed expositions of individual material. In these
materials there are very many typical formations which are
unmistakably <em>analogies</em> with <em>mythological formations</em><a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. There
arose from the perception of this relationship a new and
valuable source for comparative study. The acceptance of
the possibility of such a comparison will not be granted immediately,
but the question is only whether the materials to
be compared really are similar or not. It will also be contended
that pathological and mythological formations are not
immediately comparable. But this objection must not be
raised <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i>, for only a conscientious comparison can determine
whether any true parallelism exists or not. At the present
moment all we know is that they are both structures of
the imagination which, like all such products, rest essentially
upon the activity of the unconscious. Experience must teach
us whether such a comparison is valid. The results hitherto
obtained are so encouraging that further work along these
lines seems to me most hopeful and important. I made
practical use of the constructive method in a case which
Flournoy published in the <cite>Archives de Psychologie</cite>, although
he offered no opinion as to its nature at that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>The case dealt with a rather neurotic young lady who, in
Flournoy's publication, described how surprised she was at
the connected phantasy-formations which penetrated from the
unconscious into the conscious. I subjected these phantasies,
which the lady herself reproduced in some detail, to my constructive
methods and gave the results of these investigations
in my book, "The Psychology of the Unconscious."</p>

<p>This book has, I regret to say, met with many perhaps
inevitable misunderstandings. But I have had one precious
consolation, for my book received the approval of Flournoy
himself, who published the original case which he knew
personally. It is to be hoped that later works will make
the standpoint of the Zürich school intelligible to a wider
public. Whoever, by the help of this work, has taken the
trouble to grasp the essence of the constructive method, will
readily imagine how great are the difficulties of investigation,
and how much greater still are the difficulties of objective
presentation of such investigations.</p>

<p>Among the many difficulties and opportunities for misunderstanding
I should like to adduce one difficulty which is
especially characteristic. In an intensive study of Schreber's
or any similar case, it will be discovered that these patients
are consumed by the desire for a new world-philosophy
which may be of the most bizarre kind. Their aim is
obviously to create a system such as will help them in the
assimilation of unknown psychical phenomena, <i>i.e.</i> enable
them to adapt their own unconscious to the world. This
arrangement produces a subjective system which must be
considered as a necessary transition-stage on the path to
the adaptation of their personality in regard to the world in
general. But the patient remains stationary at this transitory
stage and assumes his subjective view is the world's,
hence he remains ill. He cannot free himself from his subjectivism
and does not find the link to objective thinking, <i>i.e.</i>
to society. He does not reach the real summit of self-understanding,
for he remains with a merely subjective understanding
of himself. But a <em>mere</em> subjective understanding is not
real and adequate. As Feuerbach says: <em>Understanding is only</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
<em>real when it is in accord with that of some other rational beings</em>.
Then it becomes objective<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and the link with life is reached.</p>

<p>I am convinced that not a few will raise the objection that
in the first place the psychological process of adaptation does
not proceed by the method of first creating a world-philosophy;
secondly, that it is in itself a sign of unhealthy mental disposition
even to make the attempt to adapt oneself by way of
a "world-philosophy."</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there are innumerable persons who are capable
of adaptation without creating any preliminary philosophy.
If they ever arrive at any general theory of the world
it is always subsequently. But, on the other hand, there are
just as many who are only able to adapt themselves by means
of a preliminary intellectual formulation. To everything
which they do not understand they are unable to adapt
themselves. Generally it comes about that they do adapt
themselves just in so far as they can grasp the situation intellectually.
To this latter group seem to belong all those
patients to whom we have been giving our consideration.</p>

<p>Medical experience has taught us that there are two large
groups of functional nervous disorders. The one embraces
all those forms of disease which are designated <em>hysterical</em>,
the other all those forms which the French school has designated
<em>psychasthenic</em>. Although the line of demarcation is
rather uncertain, one can mark off two psychological types
which are obviously different; their psychology is diametrically
opposed. I have called these&mdash;the <em>Introverted</em> and
<em>Extroverted</em> types. The hysteric belongs to the type of <em>Extroversion</em>,
the psychasthenic to the type of <em>Introversion</em>, as
does dementia præcox, in so far as we know it to-day. This
terminology, <em>Introversion</em> and <em>Extroversion</em>, is bound up with
my way of regarding mental phenomena as forms of energy.
I postulate a hypothetical fundamental striving which I designate
<em>libido</em>.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> In the classical use of the word, <em>libido</em> never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>had an exclusively sexual connotation as it has in medicine.
The word <em>interest</em>, as Claparède once suggested to me, could
be used in this special sense, if this expression had to-day
a less extensive application. Bergson's concept, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan vital</i>,
would also serve if this expression were less biological and
more psychological. Libido is intended to be an energising
expression for <em>psychological values</em>. The psychological value
is something active and determining; hence it can be regarded
from the energic standpoint without any pretence of
exact measurement.</p>

<p>The introverted type is characterised by the fact that his
libido is turned towards his own personality to a certain
extent&mdash;he finds within himself the unconditioned value.
The extroverted type has his libido to a certain extent externally;
he finds the unconditioned value outside himself. The
introvert regards everything from the aspect of his own personality;
the extrovert is dependent upon the value of his
object. I must emphasise the statement that this question
of types is <em>the</em> question of our psychology, and that every
further advance must probably proceed by way of this question.
The difference between these types is almost alarming
in extent. So far there is only one small preliminary
communication by myself<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> on this theory of type, which
is particularly important for the conception of dementia
præcox. On the psychiatric side Gross<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> has called attention
to the existence of two psychological types. His two types
are (1) those with limited but deep consciousness, and (2)
those with broad but superficial consciousness. The former
correspond to my introverted and the latter to my extroverted
type. In my article I have collected some other instances
among which I would especially call attention to the striking
description of the two types given by William James in his
book on "Pragmatism." Fr. Th. Vischer has differentiated
the two types very wittily by her division of the learned into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
"reason-mongers," and "matter-mongers." In the sphere
of psychoanalysis Freud follows the psychology of Extraversion,
Adler that of Introversion. The irreconcilable opposition
between the views of Freud and those of Adler (see
especially his book "Über den nervösen Charakter") is
readily explained by the existence of two diametrically opposed
psychological types which view the same things from entirely
different aspects. An Extrovert can hardly, or only with
great difficulty, come to any understanding with an Introvert,
on any delicate psychological question.</p>

<p>An Extrovert can hardly conceive the necessity which
compels the Introvert to conquer the world by means of a
system. And yet this necessity exists, otherwise we should
have no philosophical systems and dogmas, presumed to be
universally valid. Civilised humanity would be only empiricists
and the sciences only the experimental sciences. Causalism
and empiricism are undoubtedly mighty forces in our present-day
mental life but it may come to be otherwise.</p>

<p>This difference in type is the first great obstacle which
stands in the way of an understanding concerning fundamental
conceptions of our psychology. A second objection arises
from the circumstance that the constructive method, faithful
to itself, must adapt itself to the lines of the delusion. The
direction along which the patient develops his morbid thoughts
has to be accepted seriously, and followed out to its end;
the investigator thus places himself at the standpoint of the
psychosis. This procedure may expose him to the suspicion
of being deranged himself; or at least risks a misunderstanding
which is considered terribly disgraceful&mdash;he may himself
have some world-philosophy! The confirmation of such a
possibility is as bad as being "unscientific." But every one
has a world-philosophy though not every one knows he has.
And those who do not know it have simply an unconscious
and therefore inadequate and archaic philosophy. But everything
psychological that is allowed to remain in the mind
neglected and not developed, remains in a primitive state.
A striking instance of how universal theories are influenced
by unconscious archaic points of view has been furnished by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
a famous German historian whose name matters to us not
at all. This historian took it for granted that once upon
a time people propagated themselves through incest, for
in the first human families the brother was assigned to the
sister. This theory is wholly based upon his still unconscious
belief in Adam and Eve as the first and only parents of mankind.
It is on the whole better to discover for oneself a
modern world-philosophy, or at least to make use of some
decent system which will prevent any errors of that kind.</p>

<p>One could put up with being despised as the possessor of
a world-philosophy; but there is a greater danger. The
public may come to believe the philosophy, beaten out by the
constructive method, is to be regarded as a theoretical and objectively
valid insight into the meaning of the world in general.</p>

<p>I must now again point out that it is an obstinate,
scholastic misunderstanding not to be able to distinguish
between a world-philosophy which is only psychological, and
an extra-psychological theory, which concerns the objective
thing. It is absolutely essential that the student of the
results of the constructive method should be able to draw this
distinction. In its first results the constructive method does
not produce anything that could be called a scientific theory;
it furnishes the <em>psychological lines of development</em>, a <em>path</em> so to
say. I must here refer the reader to my book, "Psychology
of the Unconscious."</p>

<p>The analytic reductive method has the advantage of being
much simpler than the constructive method. The former
reduces to well-known universal elements of an extremely
simple nature. The latter has, with extremely complicated
material, to construct the further path to some often unknown
end. This obliges the psychologist to take full account of all
those forces which are at work in the human mind. The
reductive method strives to replace the religious and philosophical
needs of man, by their more elementary components,
following the principle of the "nothing but," as James so
aptly calls it. But to <em>construct</em> aright, we must accept the
developed aspirations as indispensable components, essential
elements, of spiritual growth. Such work extends far beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
empirical concepts but that is in accordance with the nature
of the human soul which has never hitherto rested content
with experience alone. Everything new in the human mind
proceeds from speculation. Mental development proceeds by
way of speculation, never by way of limitation to mere experience.
I realise that my views are parallel with those of
Bergson, and that in my book the concept of the libido which
I have given, is a concept parallel to that of "élan vital";
my constructive method corresponds to Bergson's "intuitive
method." I, however, confine myself to the psychological
side and to practical work. When I first read Bergson a
year and a half ago I discovered to my great pleasure everything
which I had worked out practically, but expressed by
him in consummate language and in a wonderfully clear
philosophic style.</p>

<p>Working speculatively with psychological material there
is a risk of being sacrificed to the general misunderstanding
which bestows the value of an objective theory upon the line
of psychological evolution thus elaborated. So many people
feel themselves in this way at pains to find grounds whether
such a theory is correct or not. Those who are particularly
brilliant even discover that the fundamental concepts can be
traced back to Heraclitus or some one even earlier. Let me
confide to these knowing folk that the fundamental ideas
employed in the constructive method stretch back even beyond
any historical philosophy, viz. to the dynamic "views" of
primitive peoples. If the result of the constructive method
were scientific theory, it would go very ill with it, for then it
would be a falling back to the deepest superstition. But
since the constructive method results in something far removed
from scientific theory the great antiquity of the basic
concepts therein must speak in favour of its extreme correctness.
Not until the constructive method has presented us
with much practical experience can we come to the construction
of a <em>scientific theory, a theory of the psychological lines of
development</em>. But we must first of all content ourselves with
confirming these lines individually.</p>

<h3>FOREWORD TO CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<p>This essay was originally written in 1913, when I limited
myself entirely to presenting an essential part of the psychological
point of view inaugurated by <em>Freud</em>. A few months
ago my Swiss publisher asked for a second and revised
edition. The many and great changes which the last few
years have brought about in our understanding of the
psychology of the unconscious necessitated a substantial
enlargement of my essay. In this new edition some expositions
about <em>Freud's</em> theories are shortened, whilst <em>Adler's</em>
psychological views are more fully considered, and&mdash;so far
as the scope of this paper permits&mdash;a general outline of
my own views are given. I must at the outset draw the
reader's attention to the fact that this is no longer an easy
"popular" scientific paper, but a presentation making great
demands upon the patience and attention of the reader.
The material is extremely complicated and difficult. I do
not for a moment deceive myself into thinking this contribution
is in any way conclusive or adequately convincing. Only
detailed scientific treatises about the various problems touched
upon in these pages could really do justice to the subject.
Any one who wishes to go deeply into the questions that are
raised here must be referred to the special literature of the
subject. My attention is solely to give the orientation in
regard to the newest concepts of the inner nature of unconscious
psychology. I consider the subject of the unconscious
to be specially important and opportune at this moment. In
my opinion, it would be a great loss if this problem, concerning
every one so closely as it does, were to disappear from
the horizon of the educated lay public, by being interned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
some inaccessible specialised scientific journal. The psychological
events that accompany the present war&mdash;the incredible
brutalisation of public opinion, the epidemic of mutual
calumnies, the unsuspected mania for destruction, the unexampled
flood of mendacity, and man's incapacity to arrest
the bloody demon&mdash;are they not, one and all, better adapted
than anything else, to force obtrusively the problem of the
chaotic unconscious&mdash;which slumbers uneasily beneath the
ordered world of consciousness,&mdash;before the eyes of every
thinking individual? This war has inexorably shown to the
man of culture that he is still a barbarian. It testifies also
what an iron scourge awaits him, if ever again it should
occur to him to make his neighbour responsible for his own
bad qualities. The psychology of the individual corresponds
to the psychology of nations. What nations do, each individual
does also, and as long as the individual does it, the
nation will do it too. A metamorphosis in the attitude of
the individual is the only possible beginning of a transformation
in the psychology of the nation. The great problems
of humanity have never been solved by universal laws, but
always and only by a remodelling of the attitude of the
individual. If ever there was a time when self-examination
was the absolutely indispensable and the only right thing, it
is now, in the present catastrophic epoch. But he who
bethinks himself about his own being strikes against the
confines of the unconscious, which indeed contains precisely
that which it is most needful for him to know.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Being a Survey of the Modern Theory and Method of
Analytical Psychology</em></p>


<p class="p3">I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Beginnings of Psychoanalysis</span></p>

<p>In common with other sciences, psychology had to go through
its scholastic-philosophic stage, and to some extent this has
lasted on into the present time. This philosophic psychology
has incurred our condemnation in that it decides <em>ex cathedra</em>
what is the nature of the soul, and whence and how it derives its
attributes. The spirit of modern scientific investigation has
summarily disposed of all these phantasies and in their place
has established an exact empiric method. We owe to this our
present-day experimental psychology or "<em>psychophysiology</em>,"
as the French call it. This new direction originated with
Fechner, that Janus-minded spirit, who in his remarkable
<cite>Psychophysik</cite> (1860) embarked on the mighty enterprise of
introducing the physical standpoint into the conception of
psychical phenomena. The whole idea of this work&mdash;and not
least its astonishing mistakes&mdash;proved most fruitful in results.
For Wundt, Fechner's young contemporary, carried on his
work, and it is Wundt's great erudition, enormous power of
work and genius for elaborating methods of experimental
research, which have given to modern psychology its prevailing
direction.</p>

<p>Until quite recently experimental psychology remained
essentially academic. The first notable attempt to utilise some
few at any rate of its innumerable experimental methods in
the service of practical psychology came from the psychiatrists
of the former Heidelberg school (Kræpelin, Aschaffenburg, etc.);
it is quite intelligible that the psychotherapists should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
the first to feel the urgent need for more exact knowledge of
psychic processes.</p>

<p>Next came pedagogy, making its own demands upon
psychology. Out of this has recently grown up an "experimental
pedagogy," and in this field Neumann in Germany
and Binet in France have rendered signal services. The
physician, the so-called "nerve-specialist," has the most
urgent need of psychological knowledge if he would really
help his patients, for neurotic disturbances, such as hysteria,
and all things classed as "nervousness," are of psychic origin,
and necessarily demand psychic treatment. Cold water, light,
air, electricity, magnetism, etc., are only effective temporarily,
and quite often are of no use at all. They are frequently
introduced into treatment in a not very commendable fashion,
simply because reliance is placed upon their suggestive effect.
But it is in his soul that the patient is really sick; in those
most complicated and lofty functions which we scarcely dare
to include in the province of medicine. The doctor must
needs, in such a case, be a psychologist, must needs understand
the human soul. He cannot evade the urgent demand
upon him. So he naturally turns for help to psychology, since
his psychiatry text-books have nothing to offer him. But
modern experimental psychology is very far from being able
to afford him any connected insight into the most vital
psychic processes, that is not its aim. As far as possible it
tries to isolate those simple elementary phenomena which
border on the physiological, and then study them in an isolated
state. It quite ignores the infinite variation and movement of
the mental life of the individual, and accordingly, its knowledge
and its facts are so many isolated details, uninspired by any
comprehensive idea capable of bringing them into co-ordination.
Hence it comes about that the inquirer after the secrets
of the human soul, learns rather less than nothing from experimental
psychology. He would be better advised to abandon
exact science, take off his scholar's gown, say farewell to his
study, and then, strong in manly courage, set out to wander
through the world; alike through the horrors of prisons, lunatic
asylums and hospitals, through dreary outlying taverns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
through brothels and gambling-halls, into elegant drawing-rooms,
the Stock Exchanges, socialist meetings, churches,
revival gatherings of strange religious sects, experiencing in
his own person love and hate and every kind of suffering.
He would return laden with richer knowledge than his yard-long
text-books could ever have given him, and thus equipped,
he can indeed be a physician to his patients, for he understands
the soul of man. He may be pardoned if his respect
for the "corner-stones" of experimental psychology is no
longer very considerable. There is a great gulf fixed between
what science calls "psychology," on the one hand, and what
the practice of everyday life expects from psychology on the
other.</p>

<p>This need became the starting-point of a new psychology
whose inception we owe first and foremost to the genius of
Sigmund Freud, of Vienna, to his researches into functional
nervous disease. The new type of psychology might be described
as "analytical psychology." Professor Bleuler has
coined the name "Deep Psychology,"<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> to indicate that the
Freudian psychology takes as its province the deeper regions,
the "hinterland" of the soul, the "unconscious." Freud
names his method of investigation "psychoanalysis."</p>

<p>Before we approach the matter more closely, we must first
consider the relationship of the new psychology to the earlier
science. Here we encounter a singular little farce which once
again proves the truth of Anatole France's apothegm: "Les
savants ne sont pas curieux."</p>

<p>The first important piece of work<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> in this new field
awakened only the faintest echo, in spite of the fact that it
offered a new and fundamental conception of the neuroses.
Certain writers expressed their approbation, and then, on the
next page, proceeded to explain their cases of hysteria in the
good old way. It was much as if a man should subscribe fully
to the idea of the earth's being spherical, and yet continue to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
represent it as flat. Freud's next publications<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> were practically
unnoticed, although they contributed findings of immeasurable
importance to the domain of psychiatry. When
in 1900 he produced the first real psychological elucidation
of the dream<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> (previously there had reigned over this territory
a suitable nocturnal darkness), he was ridiculed; and when
in the middle of the last decade he began to illumine the
psychology of sexuality itself,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and at the same time the
"Zürich school" decided to range itself on his side, a storm
of abuse, sometimes of the coarsest kind, burst upon him,
nor has it yet ceased to rage. At the last South-West
German Congress of alienists in Baden-Baden, the adherents
of the new psychology had the pleasure of hearing Hoche,
University Professor of Psychiatry at Freiburg in Breisgau,
describe the movement in a long and much-applauded
address, as an outbreak of mental aberration <em>among doctors</em>.
The old proverb: "Medicus medicum non decimat" was
here quite put to shame. How carefully the question had
been studied was shewn by the naïve remark of one of the
most distinguished neurologists of Paris, which I myself heard
at the International Congress in 1907: "It is true I have not
read Freud's works (he did not happen to know any German!),
but as for his theories, they are nothing but a mauvaise
plaisanterie." Freud, dignified, masterly, once said to me,
I first became clearly conscious of the value of my discoveries
when they were met everywhere with resistance and anger;
since that time I have judged the value of my work according
to the degree of opposition provoked. It is against my sexual
theory that the greatest indignation is felt, so it would seem
therein lies my best work. Perhaps after all the real benefactors
of mankind are its false teachers, for opposition to the
false doctrine pushes men willy nilly into truth. Your truth-teller
is a pernicious fellow, he drives men into error."</p>

<p>The reader must now calmly accept the idea that in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
psychology he is dealing with something quite unique, if not
indeed with some altogether irrational, sectarian, or occult
wisdom; for what else could possibly provoke all the scientific
authorities to turn away on the very threshold and utterly
refuse to cross it?</p>

<p>Accordingly, we must look more closely into this psychology.
As long ago as Charcot's time it was recognised that
neurotic symptoms are "psychogenic," that is, that they have
their origin in the psyche. It was also known, thanks mainly
to the work of the Nancy School, that every hysterical symptom
can be exactly reproduced by means of suggestion. But <em>how</em>
a hysterical system arises, and its relationship to psychic
causes, were altogether unknown. In the beginning of the
eighties Dr. Breuer, an old Viennese doctor, made a discovery<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
which was really the true starting-point of the new
psychology. He had a very intelligent young patient (a woman)
suffering from hysteria, who exhibited the following symptoms
among others: A spastic paralysis of the right arm, occasional
disturbances of consciousness or twilight-states, and
loss of the power of speech in so far as she no longer retained
any knowledge of her mother-tongue, and could only express
herself in English (so-called systematic aphasia). They sought
at that time, and still seek, in such a case to establish some
theory of anatomical disturbance, although there was just as
little disturbance in the arm-centre in the brain as in that of
any normal man who boxes another's ears. The symptomatology
of hysteria is full of anatomical impossibilities; such
as the case of the lady who had lost her hearing completely
through some hysterical malady. None the less she often
used to sing, and once when she was singing her doctor sat
down at the piano unnoticed by her and softly accompanied
her. Passing from one strophe to another he suddenly altered
the key, and she, quite unconscious of what she was doing,
sang on in the altered key. Thus she heard&mdash;yet did not hear.
The various forms of systematic blindness present similar
phenomena. We have the case of a man suffering from complete
hysterical blindness. In the course of the treatment he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
recovers his sight, but at first, and for some long time, only partially:
he could see everything with one exception&mdash;people's
heads. He saw all the people around him without heads.
Thus he saw&mdash;yet did not see. From a large number of like experiences
it has long been concluded that it is only the patient's
consciousness which does not see, does not hear, but the sense-function
has nothing at all the matter with it. This state of
affairs is directly contradictory to the essence of an organic
disturbance, which always materially involves the function.</p>

<p>After this digression let us return to Breuer's case. Since
there was no organic cause for the disturbance, the case was
clearly to be regarded as hysterical, that is, psychogenic. Dr.
Breuer had noticed that if during her twilight-states (whether
spontaneous or artificially induced) he let the patient freely
express the reminiscences and phantasies that thronged in
upon her, her condition was afterwards much improved for
some hours. He made systematic use of this observation in her
further treatment. The patient herself invented the appropriate
name for it of "talking cure" or, in jest, "chimney sweeping."</p>

<p>Her illness began whilst she was nursing her dying father.
It is easy to understand that her phantasies busied themselves
mainly with this disturbing time. In the twilight-states
memories of this period reappeared with photographic fidelity,
distinct in every detail: no waking recollection is ever so
plastically and exactly reproduced. The term hypermnesia is
applied to this heightening of the power of memory, which
occurs without difficulty in certain states of contracted consciousness.
Remarkable things now came to light. Out of
the many things told, one ran somewhat as follows.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>On a certain night she was in a state of great anxiety about
her father's high temperature. She sat by his bed, waiting
for the surgeon who was coming from Vienna to perform an
operation. Her mother had gone out of the room for a little
while, and Anna (the patient) sat by the bed, with her right
arm hanging over the back of her chair. She fell into a kind
of waking-dream in which she saw a black snake come out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
from the wall and approach the sick man, prepared to bite.
(It is very probable that some real snakes had been seen in
the fields behind the house, and that she had been frightened
by them; this would furnish the material for her hallucination.)
She wanted to drive the creature away, but felt
paralysed; her right arm, hanging over the chair, had "gone
to sleep," was anæsthetic and paretic, and as she looked
her fingers turned into little snakes with death's heads (the
nails). Probably she tried to drive the snake away with her
paralysed right hand, and thereby the anæsthesia and paralysis
became associated with the snake-hallucination. Even after
the snake had disappeared, her terror remained great. She
tried to pray, but found she had no words in any language,
until at length she managed to remember some English
nursery rhymes, and then she could go on thinking and praying
in that language.</p>

<p>This was the actual scene in which the paralysis and
speech-disturbance arose; the describing it served to remove
the speech-trouble, and in this same fashion the case was
finally completely cured.</p>

<p>I must restrict myself to this one instance. In Breuer
and Freud's book there is a wealth of similar examples. It
is easy to understand that scenes such as these make a very
strong impression, and accordingly there is an inclination to
attribute a causal significance to them in the genesis of the
symptoms. The then current conception of hysteria, arising
from the English "nervous shock" theory, which Charcot
strongly supported, came in conveniently to elucidate Breuer's
discovery, hence arose the <em>trauma-theory</em> maintaining that
the hysterical symptom and in so far as the symptoms comprise
the disease, hysteria itself, arises from some <em>psychic
injury</em> (or <em>trauma</em>), the effect of which is retained in the
unconscious indefinitely. Freud, working as Breuer's colleague,
amply confirmed this discovery. It was fully demonstrated
that not one out of the many hundred hysterical
symptoms came down ready made from heaven; they had
already been conditioned by past psychic experiences. To
some extent, therefore, this new conception opened up a field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
of very important empirical work. But Freud's tireless
spirit of inquiry could not long rest content at this superficial
layer, since already there obtruded deeper and more difficult
problems. It is obvious enough that moments of great fear
and anxiety, such as Breuer's patient went through, would
leave behind a lasting effect, but how is it that these happenings
are themselves already deeply stamped with the mark of
morbidity? Must we suppose that the trying sick-nursing in
itself produce such a result? If so, such effects should occur
much more frequently, for there are, unfortunately, many
trying cases of sick-nursing, and the nurse's nervous constitution
is by no means always of the soundest. To this
problem medicine gives its admirable answer; the "x" in
the calculation is <em>predisposition</em>; there is a tendency to these
things. But for Freud the problem was, what exactly constitutes
this predisposition? This question led logically to
an investigation of all that had preceded the psychic trauma.
It is a matter of common observation that distressing scenes
have markedly different effects upon the different participants,
and that things which to some are quite indifferent
or even pleasant, such as frogs, mice, snakes, cats, excite the
greatest aversion in others. There are the cases of women
who can calmly be present at a very bad operation, but who
tremble all over with horror and nausea at the touch of a
cat. By way of illustration let me give the case of a young
lady suffering from severe hysteria following a sudden fright.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
She had been at a social gathering, and was on her way
home at midnight accompanied by several acquaintances,
when a carriage came up behind them at full speed. All
the others moved out of the way, but she, beside herself with
fright, ran down the middle of the road just in front of the
horses. The coachman cracked his whip and cursed and
swore in vain. She ran down the whole length of the street
till a bridge was reached. There her strength failed her, and
to escape the horses' feet in her despair she would have
jumped into the water had not passers-by prevented her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
This same lady happened to be in Petrograd during that sanguinary
Revolution of the 22nd of January, and saw a street
cleared by the volleys of soldiers. All around her people
were dropping down dead or wounded, but she retained her
calmness and self-possession, and caught sight of a door
which gave her escape into another street. These terrible
moments agitated her neither at the time nor later on. She
was quite well afterwards, indeed felt better than usual.</p>

<p>Essentially similar reactions can quite often be observed.
Hence it follows that the intensity of the trauma is of small
pathogenic importance; the peculiar circumstances determine
its pathogenic effect. Here, then, we have the key which
enables us to unlock at least one of the anterooms to an
understanding of predisposition. We must now ask what
were the unusual circumstances in this carriage scene? The
terror and apprehension began as soon as the lady heard the
trampling horses. For a moment she thought this portended
some terrible fate, her death, or something equally frightful;
the next, she lost all sense of what she was doing.</p>

<p>This powerful impression was evidently connected in some
way with the horses. The predisposition of the patient to
react in such an exaggerated fashion to a not very remarkable
incident, might result from the fact that horses had some
special significance for her. It might be suspected that she
had experienced some dangerous accident with them; this
actually turned out to be the case. When a child of about
seven years old she was out for a drive with the coachman;
the horses shied and galloped at full speed towards a steep
river-bank. The coachman jumped down, and shouted to
her to do the same, but in her extreme terror she could scarcely
bring herself to obey. She did, however, just manage to
jump out in the nick of time, whilst the horses and carriage
were dashed to pieces below. No proof is needed that such
an experience must leave a lasting impression behind it.
But it does not offer any explanation for such an exaggerated
reaction to an inadequate stimulus. So far we only know
that this later symptom had its prologue in childhood, but
its pathological aspect remains obscure. To penetrate into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the heart of such a mystery it was necessary to accumulate
further material. And the greater our experience the clearer
does it become that in all cases with such traumatic experiences
analysed up to the present, there co-exists a special kind
of disturbance which can only be described as a derangement
in the sphere of <em>love</em>. Not all of us give due credit to the
anomalous nature of love, reaching high as heaven, sinking
low as hell, uniting in itself all extremes of good and evil, of
lofty and low.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>As soon as Freud recognised this, a decisive change came
about in his view. In his earlier researches, whilst more or
less dominated by Charcot's trauma-theory, he had sought
for the origin of the neurosis in actual traumatic experiences;
but now the centre of gravity shifted to a very different point.
This is best demonstrated by reference to our case; we can
understand that horses might easily play a significant part in
the patient's life, but it is not clear why there should be this
later reaction, so exaggerated, so uncalled for. It is not her
fear of horses which forms the morbid factor in this curious
story; to get at the real truth we must remember our empirical
conclusion, that, side by side with traumatic experiences, there
is also invariably present some disturbance in the sphere of
love. We must now go on to inquire whether perhaps there is
anything unsatisfactory in this respect in the case under
review.</p>

<p>Our patient has a young man friend, to whom she is
thinking of becoming engaged, she loves him and expects to
be happy with him. At first nothing more is discoverable;
but the investigator must not let himself be deterred by a
negative result in the beginning of this preliminary questioning.
When the direct way does not lead to the desired end,
an indirect way may be taken. We accordingly turn our
attention back to that strange moment when she ran away in
front of the horses. We inquire who were her companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
and what kind of social gathering was it, and find it was a
farewell-party to her best friend, on her departure to a foreign
health-resort on account of a nervous breakdown. We are
told this friend is happily married and is the mother of one
child. We may well doubt the assertion that she is happy.
If she really were so, it is hardly to be supposed she would
be "nervous" and in need of a cure. When I attacked the
situation from a different vantage-ground, I learnt that our
patient&mdash;after this episode&mdash;had been taken by her friends to
the nearest safe place&mdash;her host's house. In her exhausted
state he took charge of her. When the patient came to this
part of her story, she suddenly broke off, was embarrassed,
fidgeted and tried to turn the subject. Evidently some disagreeable
reminiscences had suddenly cropped up. After obstinate
resistances had been overcome, she admitted something
very strange had happened that night. Her host had made her
a passionate declaration of love, thus occasioning a situation
that, in the absence of his wife, might well be considered both
painful and difficult. Ostensibly this declaration came upon
her like a "bolt from the blue." But a small dose of criticism
applied to such an assertion soon apprises us that these things
never do drop suddenly from the sky; they always have their
previous history. It was a task of the following weeks to dig
out piecemeal a long love-story. I will attempt to sketch in
the picture as it appeared finally.</p>

<p>As a child the patient was a thorough tomboy, loved boys'
boisterous games, laughed at her own sex, and would have
nothing to do with feminine ways or occupations. After
puberty, just when the sex-issue should have meant much to
her, she began to shun all society; she seemingly hated and
despised everything which could remind her even remotely
of the biological destiny of mankind, and lived in a world of
phantasy which had nothing in common with rude reality.
Thus, till her twenty-fourth year, she escaped all the little
adventures, hopes and expectations which ordinarily move a
girl at this age. But finally she got to know the two men
who were destined to destroy the thorny hedge which had
grown up around her. Mr. A. was her best friend's husband;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Mr. B. was their bachelor-friend. She liked both; but pretty
soon found B. the more sympathetic, and an intimacy grew
up between them which made an engagement seem likely.
Through her friendship with him and with Mrs. A., she often
met Mr. A. His presence excited her inexplicably, made her
nervous. Just at this time she went to a big party. All her
friends were there. She became lost in thought, and in a
reverie was playing with her ring, when suddenly it slipped
out of her hand and rolled under the table. Both men tried
to find it and Mr. B. managed to get it. With a meaning
smile he put the ring back on her finger, and said, "You
know what that means!" Overcome by some strange, irresistible
feeling, she tore the ring from her finger and flung it
out of the open window. Naturally a painful moment for all
ensued, and she soon went away, much depressed. A little
while after, so-called chance brought her for her summer
holidays to the health-resort where A. and his wife were staying.
It was then that Mrs. A. began to suffer from nerve-trouble,
and frequently felt too unwell to leave the house. So
our patient could often go out for walks alone with A. One
day they were out in a small boat. She was boisterously
merry and fell overboard. Mr. A. saved her with difficulty as
she could not swim, and he managed to lift her into the boat in
a half-unconscious state. Then he kissed her. This romantic
event wove fast the bonds between them. In self-defence she
did her best to get herself engaged to B. and to persuade herself
that she loved him. Of course this queer comedy could
not escape the sharp eye of feminine jealousy. Mrs. A., her
friend, guessed the secret, and was so much upset by it that
her nervous condition grew bad enough to necessitate her
trying a cure at a foreign health-resort. At the farewell
gathering the demon came to our patient and whispered:
"To-night he will be alone, something must happen to you
so that you can go to his house." And so indeed it came
about; her strange behaviour made her friends take her to
his house, and thus she achieved her desire.</p>

<p>After this explanation the reader will probably be inclined
to assume that only diabolical subtlety could think out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
set in motion such a chain of circumstances. There is no
doubt about the subtlety, but the moral evaluation is less
certain. I desire to lay special emphasis upon the fact that
the patient was <em>in no sense conscious of the motives</em> of this
dramatic performance. The incident apparently just came
about of itself without any conscious motive whatsoever.
But the whole previous history makes it perfectly clear that
everything was most ingeniously directed towards the other
aim; whilst the conscious self was apparently working to
bring about the engagement to Mr. B., the unconscious
compulsion to take the other road was still stronger.</p>

<p>So once more we must return to our original question,
whence comes the pathological, the peculiar and exaggerated
reaction to the trauma? Relying on a conclusion obtained
from other analogous experiences, we ventured the conjecture
that in the present case we had to do with a disturbance
in the love-life, in addition to the trauma. This supposition
was thoroughly borne out; the trauma, which was apparently
the cause of the illness, was merely the <em>occasion</em> for some
factor, till then unconscious, to manifest itself. This was
the <em>significant erotic conflict</em>. With this finding the trauma
loses its pathogenic significance and is replaced by a much
deeper and more comprehensive conception, which regards
the erotic conflict as the pathogenic agent. This conception
may be described as the sexual theory of the neurosis.</p>

<p>I am often asked why it is just the erotic conflict rather
than any other which is the cause of the neurosis. There is
but one answer to this. No one asserts that this ought
necessarily to be the case, but as a simple matter of fact it
is always found to be so, notwithstanding all the cousins and
aunts, godparents, and teachers, who rage against it. Despite
all the indignant assertions to the contrary, the problem and
conflicts of love are of fundamental importance for humanity,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
and with increasingly careful study, it comes out ever more
clearly that the love-life is of immensely greater importance
than the individual suspects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>As a consequence of the recognition that the true root of
the neurosis is not the trauma, but the hidden erotic conflict,
the trauma loses its pathogenic significance.</p>


<p class="p3">II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Sexual Theory.</span></p>

<p>Thus, it will be seen, the theory had to be shifted on to an
entirely different basis, for the investigation now had to face
the erotic conflict itself. Our example shows that this contains
extremely abnormal elements and cannot, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">primâ facie</i>, be
compared with an ordinary love conflict. It is surprising,
indeed hardly credible, that only the postulated affection
should be conscious, whilst the real passion remained unknown
to the patient. But in this case it is beyond dispute
that the real erotic relation remained unillumined, whilst
the field of consciousness was dominated by the assumption.
If we try to formulate this fact, something like the following
proposition results: <em>in a neurosis</em>, two erotic tendencies exist
which stand in extreme opposition to one another, and one at
least is unconscious. Against this formula the objection can
be raised that it has obviously been derived from this one particular
case, and is therefore lacking in general validity. The
criticism will be the more readily urged because no one unpossessed
of special reasons is willing to admit that the erotic
conflict is of universal prevalence. On the contrary, it is
assumed that this conflict belongs more properly to the sphere
of novels, since it is generally depicted as something in the
nature of such wild adventures as are described by Karin
Michaelis in her "Aberrations of Marriage," or by Forel in
"The Sexual Question." But indeed this is not the case; for
we know the wildest and most moving dramas are not played
on the stage, but every day in the hearts of ordinary men and
women who pass by without exciting attention, and who betray
to the world, save through the symbol of a nervous breakdown,
nothing of the conflicts that rage within them. But what
is so difficult for the layman to grasp is the fact that in most
cases patients have no suspicion whatever of the internecine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
war raging in their unconscious. But remembering that there
are many people who understand nothing at all about themselves,
we shall be less surprised at the realisation that there
are also people who are utterly unaware of their actual conflicts.</p>

<p>If the reader is now inclined to admit the possible
existence of pathogenic, and perhaps even of unconscious
conflicts, he will certainly protest that they are not erotic
conflicts. If this kind reader should happen himself to be
somewhat nervous, the mere suggestion will arouse his indignation,
for we are all inclined, as a result of our education
in school and at home, to cross ourselves three times where
we meet such words as "erotic" and "sexual"&mdash;and so we
are conveniently able to think that nothing of that nature
exists, or at least very seldom, and at a great distance from
ourselves. But it is just this attitude which in the first
instance brings about neurotic conflicts.</p>

<p>We recognise that the course of civilisation consists in
the progressive mastering of the animal element in man; it
is a process of domestication which cannot be carried through
without rebellion on the part of the animal nature still thirsting
for its liberty. Humanity forces itself to endure the restrictions
of the civilising process; but from time to time there
comes a frenzied bursting of all bonds. Antiquity had experience
of it in that wave of Dionysian orgies, surging hither
from the East, which became an essentially characteristic
element of antique culture. Its spirit was partly instrumental
in causing the numerous sects and philosophic schools
of the last century before Christ, to develop the Stoic ideal
into asceticism; and in producing from the polytheistic chaos
of those times, the ascetic twin-religions of Mithras and of
Christ. A second clearly marked wave of the Dionysian
impulse towards freedom swept over the Western world during
the Renaissance. It is difficult to judge of one's own time, but
we gain some insight if we note how the Arts are developing,
what is the prevailing type of public taste, what men read
and write, what societies they found, what "questions" are
the order of the day, and against what the Philistines are
fighting. We find in the long list of our present social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
problems that the sexual question occupies by no means the
last place. It agitates men and women who would shake
the foundations of sexual morality, and throw off the burden
of moral shame which past centuries have heaped upon Eros.
The existence of these aspirations and endeavours cannot be
simply denied, or declared indefensible; they exist and are
therefore presumably not without justification. It is both more
interesting and more useful to study carefully the basic causes
of these movements than to chime in with the lamentations
of the professional mourners over morals, who prophesy with
unction the moral downfall of humanity. The moralist least
of all trusts God, for he thinks that the beautiful tree of
humanity can only thrive by dint of being pruned, bound,
and trained on a trellis, whereas Father-Sun and Mother-Earth
have combined to make it grow joyfully in accordance
with its own laws, which are full of the deepest meaning.</p>

<p>Serious people are aware that a very real sexual problem
does exist at the present time. The rapid development of the
towns, coupled with methods of work brought about by the
extraordinary division of labour, the increasing industrialisation
of the country and the growing security of life, combine
to deprive humanity of many opportunities of expending
emotional energy. Think of the life of the peasant, whose
work so rich and full of change, affords him unconscious satisfaction
by means of its symbolic content; a like satisfaction
the factory-hand and the clerk can never know. Think of
a life with nature; of those wonderful moments when, as lord
and fructifier, man drives the plough through the earth, and
with kingly gesture scatters the seed of the future harvest;
see his justifiable awe before the destructive power of the elements,
his joy in the fruitfulness of his wife, who gives him
daughters and sons, who mean to him increased working
power and enhanced prosperity. Alas! from all this we town-dwellers,
we modern machines, are far, far removed.</p>

<p>Must we not admit that we are already deprived of the
most natural and most beautiful of all satisfactions, since we
can no longer contemplate the arrival of our own seed, the
"blessing" of children, with unmixed pleasure? Marriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
where no artifices are resorted to are rare. Is this not an
all-important departure from the joys which Mother Nature
gave her first-born sons? Can such a state of affairs bring
satisfaction? Note how men slink to their work, watch their
faces at an early morning hour in the tram-cars. One of
them makes his little wheels, and another writes trivial
things which do not interest him. What wonder is it if such
men belong to as many clubs as there are days in the
week, and that among women little societies flourish, where
they pour out on some particular hero or cause those unsatisfied
desires which the man dulls at his restaurant or club,
imbibing beer and playing at being important? To these
sources of dissatisfaction is added a more serious factor.
Nature has provided defenceless, weaponless man with a great
amount of energy to enable him not merely to bear passively
the grave dangers of existence, but also to conquer them.
Mother Nature has equipped her son for tremendous hardships
and has placed a costly premium on the overcoming of
them, as Schopenhauer quite understood when he said that
"happiness is really but the termination of unhappiness."
Civilized people are, as a rule, shielded from the immediately
pressing dangers, and they are therefore daily tempted to excess,
for in man the animal always becomes rampant when he
is not constrained by fierce necessity. Are we then indeed
unrestrained? In what orgiastic festivals do <em>we</em> dispose of
the surplus of vital power? Our moral views do not permit
us that outlet.</p>

<p>But reckon up in how many directions we are met by unsatisfied
longings; the denial of procreation and begetting, for
which purpose nature has endowed us with great energy; the
unending monotony of our highly developed modern methods
of "division of labour," which excludes any interest in the
work itself; and above all our effortless security against war,
lawlessness, robbery, epidemics, infant and woman mortality&mdash;all
this gives a sum of surplus energy which must needs find
an outlet. But how? A relatively few create quasi-natural
dangers for themselves in reckless sport; many more, seeking
to find some equivalent for their more primitive energy, take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
to alcoholic excess; others expend themselves in the rush of
money-making, or in the morbid performance of duties, in
perpetual over-work. By such means they try to escape a
dangerous storing-up of energy which might force mad outlets
for itself. It is for such reasons that we have to-day a <em>sexual
question</em>. It is in this direction that men's energy would
like to expend itself as it has done from time immemorial
in periods of security and abundance. Under such circumstances
it is not only rabbits that multiply; men and women,
too, become the sport of these accesses of nature: the sport,
because their moral views have confined them in a narrow
cage, the excessive narrowness of which was not felt so long
as harsh external necessity pressed upon them with even
greater constraint. But now the man of the cities finds
the space too circumscribed. He is surrounded by alluring
temptation, and like an invisible <em>procureur</em> there
slinks through society the knowledge of preventive methods
which evade all consequences. Why then moral restraint?
Out of religious consideration for an angry God? Apart
from the prevalence of widespread unbelief, even the
believing man might quietly ask himself whether, if he
himself were God, he would punish the youthful erotic uncontrol
of John and Mary with twice twenty-four years of
imprisonment and seething in boiling oil. Such ideas are
no longer compatible with our decorous conception of God.
The God of our time is necessarily much too tolerant
to make a great fuss over it; (knavishness and hypocrisy
are a thousand times worse). In this way the somewhat
ascetic and hypocritical sexual morality of our time has had
the ground cut from under its feet. Or is it the case that
we are now protected from dissoluteness by superior wisdom,
recognition of the nothingness of human happenings? Unfortunately
we are very far from that; rather does the
hypnotic power of tradition keep us in bonds, and through
cowardice and thoughtlessness and habit the herd goes tramping
on in this same path. But man possesses in the unconscious
a fine scent for the spirit of his time; he has an
inkling of his own possibilities and he feels in his innermost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
heart the instability of the foundations of present-day morality,
no longer supported by living religious conviction. It is thus
the greater number of the erotic conflicts of our time originate.
Instinct thirsting for liberty thrusts itself up against the
yielding barriers of morality: men are tempted, they desire
and do not desire. And because they will not and cannot think
out to its logical conclusion what it is they really desire,
their erotic conflict is largely unconscious; whence comes
neurosis. Neurosis then is most intimately bound up with
the problem of our times and represents an unsuccessful
attempt of the individual to solve the general problem in his
own person. Neurosis is a tearing in two of the <em>inner self</em>.
For most men the reason of this cleavage is the fact that their
conscious self desires to hold to its moral ideal, whilst the
unconscious strives after the amoral ideal, steadfastly rejected
by the conscious self. People of this kind would like to
appear more decent than they really are. But the conflict is
often of an opposite kind. There are those who do not outwardly
live a decent life at all and do not place the slightest
constraint upon their sexuality, but in reality this is a sinful
pose assumed for goodness knows what reasons, for down
below they have a decorous soul which has somehow gone
astray in their unconscious, just as has the real immoral
nature in the case of apparently moral people. Extremes of
conduct always arouse suspicions of the opposite tendencies in
the unconscious.</p>

<p>It was necessary to make this general statement in order
to elucidate the idea of the "erotic conflict" in analytical
psychology, for it is the key to the conception of neurosis.
We can now proceed to consider the psychoanalytic technique.
Obviously the main problem is, how to arrive by the shortest
and best path at a knowledge of the patient's "unconscious."
The method first used was hypnotism, the patient being questioned,
on the production of spontaneous phantasies observed
while in a state of hypnotic concentration. This method is
still occasionally used, but in comparison with the present
technique is primitive and frequently unsatisfactory. A
second method, evolved by the Psychiatric Clinic, Zürich, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the so-called association method,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> which is chiefly of theoretic,
experimental value. Its result is an extensive, though
superficial orientation, concerning the unconscious conflict
("complex").<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The more penetrating method is that of
dream-analysis whose discovery belongs to Sigmund Freud.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Of the dream it can be said that "the stone which the
builders rejected has become the head of the corner." It is
only in modern times that the dream (that fleeting and seemingly
insignificant product of the soul), has met with such
complete contempt. Formerly it was esteemed, as a harbinger
of fate, a warning or a consolation, a messenger of the gods.
Now we use it as a messenger of the unconscious; it must
disclose to us the secrets which our unconscious self enviously
hides from our consciousness, and it does so with astonishing
completeness.</p>

<p>On analytical investigation it becomes plain that the
dream, as we remember it, is only a façade which conceals the
contents within the house. But if, observing certain technical
rules, we get the dreamer to talk about the details of his dream,
it soon appears that his free associations group themselves in
certain directions and round certain topics. These appear to
be of personal significance, and have a meaning which at first
sight would not be suspected. Careful comparison shows that
they are in close and subtle symbolic connection with the
dream-façade.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> This particular complex of ideas in which all
the threads of the dream unite, is the conflict for which we are
seeking; is its particular form at the moment, conditioned by
the immediate circumstances. What is painful and incompatible
is in this way so covered up or split that we can call
it a wish-fulfilment; but we must immediately add that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
wishes fulfilled in the dream do not seem at first sight to
be <em>our</em> wishes, but rather the very opposite. For instance, a
daughter loves her mother tenderly, but she dreams that her
mother is dead; this causes her great grief. Such dreams,
where apparently there is no trace of any wish-fulfilment are
innumerable, and are a constant stumbling-block to our
learned critics, for&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incredible dictu</i>&mdash;they still cannot grasp
the simple distinction between the <em>manifest</em> and the <em>latent</em>
content of the dream. We must guard against such an error;
the conflict dealt with in the dream is an unconscious one,
and equally so also is the manner its solution. Our dreamer
has, as a matter of fact, the wish to get away from her mother&mdash;expressed
in the language of the unconscious, she wants
her mother to die. Now we know that a certain section of
the unconscious contains all our lost memories, and also all
those infantile impulses that cannot find any application in
adult life&mdash;a series, that is, of ruthless childish desires. We
may say that for the most part the unconscious bears an
infantile stamp; like the child's simple wish: "Daddy, when
Mummie is dead, will you marry me?" In a dream that
infantile expression of a wish is the substitute for a recent
wish to marry, which is painful to the dreamer for reasons still
undiscovered. This thought, or rather the seriousness of its
corresponding intention, is said to be "repressed into the
unconscious" and must there necessarily express itself in an
infantile way, for the material which is at the disposal of the
unconscious consists chiefly of infantile memories. As the
latest researches of the Zürich school have shown,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> these
are not only infantile memories but also "racial" memories,
extending far beyond the limits of individual existence.</p>

<p>Important desires which have not been sufficiently gratified,
or have been "repressed," during the day find their
symbolic substitution in dreams. Because moral tendencies
usually predominate in waking hours, these ungratified
desires which strive to realise themselves symbolically in the
dream are, as rule, erotic ones. It is, therefore, somewhat
rash to tell dreams before one who understands, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
symbolism is often extremely transparent to him who knows
the rules! The clearest in this respect are "anxiety-dreams"
which are so common, and which invariably symbolise a
strong erotic desire.</p>

<p>Often the dream apparently deals with quite irrelevant
details, thereby making a ridiculous impression; or else it is
so unintelligible that we are simply amazed at it, and accordingly
have to overcome considerable resistance in ourselves
before we can set to work seriously to unravel its symbolic
weaving by patient work. But when at last we penetrate into
its real meaning we find ourselves at a bound in the very
heart of the dreamer's secrets, and find to our astonishment
that an apparently senseless dream is quite full of sense, and
deals with extraordinarily important and serious problems of
the soul. Having acquired this knowledge we cannot refrain
from giving rather more credit to the old superstitions concerning
the meaning of dreams for which our rationalising
tendencies, until lately, had no use.</p>

<p>As Freud says: "Dream-analysis is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">via regia</i> to the
unconscious." Dream-analysis leads us into the deepest personal
secrets, and it is therefore an invaluable instrument in
the hand of the psychotherapist and educator. The objections
of the opponents of this method are based, as might be expected,
upon argument, which (setting aside undercurrents of
personal feeling) show the bias of present-day Scholasticism.
It so happens that it is just the analysis of dreams which
mercilessly uncovers the deceptive morals and hypocritical
affectations of man, and shows him the under side of his
character; can we wonder if many feel that their toes have
been rather painfully trodden upon? In connection with the
dream-analysis I am always reminded of the striking statue
of Carnal Pleasure in Bâle Cathedral, which shows in front
the sweet smile of archaic sculpture, but behind is covered
with toads and serpents. Dream-analysis reverses the figure
and for once shows the other side. The ethical value of this
reality-correction (Wirklichkeitscorrectur) cannot be disputed.
It is a painful but extremely useful operation, which makes
great demands on both physician and patient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>Psychoanalysis, in so far as we are considering it as a
therapeutic technique, consists mainly of the analysis of
many dreams; the dreams in the course of the treatment
bringing up successively the contents of the unconscious in
order that they may be subjected to the disinfecting power
of daylight, and in this process many a valuable thing believed
to have been lost is found again. It is not surprising
that for those persons who have adopted a certain pose
towards themselves, psychoanalysis is at times a real torture,
since in accordance with the old mystic saying, "Give all thou
hast, then only shalt thou receive," there is first the necessity
to get rid of almost all the dearly cherished illusions, to permit
the advent of something deeper, finer, and greater, for
only through the mystery of self-sacrifice is it possible to be
"born-again." It is indeed ancient wisdom which again
sees the daylight in psychoanalytic treatment, and it is a
curious thing that this kind of psychic re-education proves
to be necessary at the height of our modern culture; this
education which in more than one respect can be compared
to the technique of Socrates, even though psychoanalysis
penetrates to much greater depths.</p>

<p>We always find in a patient some conflict, which at a particular
point, is connected with the great problems of society;
so that when the analysis has arrived at this point the
apparently individual conflict is revealed as a universal
conflict of the environment and the epoch. Neurosis is thus,
strictly speaking, nothing but an individual attempt, however
unsuccessful, at a solution of the general problem; it must
be so, for a general problem, a "question," is not an end in
itself; it only exists in the hearts and heads of individual men
and women. The "question" which troubles the patient is&mdash;whether
you like it or not&mdash;the "sexual" question, or more
precisely, the problem of present-day <em>sexual morality</em>. His
increased demands upon life and the joy of life, upon glowing
reality, can stand the necessary limitations which <em>reality</em>
sets, but not the arbitrary, ill-supported prohibitions of
present-day morals, which would curb too much the creative
spirit rising up from the depths of the darkness of the beasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
that perish. For the <em>neurotic has in him the soul of a child</em>
that can but ill-endure arbitrary limitations of which it does
not see the meaning; it tries to adopt the moral standard,
but thereby only falls into deeper disunion and distress within
itself. On the one hand it tries to suppress itself, and on the
other to free itself&mdash;this is the struggle that is called Neurosis.
If this conflict were altogether clear to consciousness it would
of course never give rise to neurotic symptoms; these only
arise when we cannot see the other side of our character, and
the urgency of the problems of that other side. In these
circumstances symptoms arise which partially express what
is unrecognised in the soul. The symptom is, therefore, an
indirect expression of unrecognised desires, which, were they
conscious, would be in violent opposition to the sufferer's
moral views. As we have already said, this dark side of the
soul does not come within the purview of consciousness, and
therefore the patient cannot deal with it, correct it, resign
himself to it, or renounce it, for he cannot be said to <em>possess</em>
the unconscious impulses. By being repressed from the
hierarchy of the conscious soul, they have become <em>autonomous
complexes</em> which can be brought again under control
by analysis of the unconscious, though not without great
resistance. There are a great many patients whose great
boast it is that the erotic conflict does not exist for them; they
are sure that the sexual question is nonsense, that they have,
so to say, no sexuality. These people do not see that other
things of unknown origin cumber their path, such as
hysterical whims, underhand tricks, from which they make
themselves, or those nearest them, suffer; nervous stomach-catarrh,
pain here and there, irritability without reason, and
a whole host of nervous symptoms. All which things show
what is wrong with them, for relatively, only a few specially
favoured by fate, avoid the great conflict.</p>

<p>Analytical psychology has already been reproached with
setting at liberty the animal instincts of men, hitherto happily
repressed, and causing thereby untold harm. This childish
apprehension clearly proves how little trust is put in the
efficacy of present-day moral principles. It is pretended that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
only morals can restrain men from dissoluteness; a much more
efficient regulator, however, is <em>necessity</em>, which sets much
more real and convincing bounds than any moral principles.
It is true that analysis liberates animal instincts, but not,
as some have said, just in order to let them loose, but rather
to make them available for higher application, in so far as
this is possible to the particular individual, and in so far
as such "sublimated" application is required. Under all
circumstances it is an advantage to be in full possession of
one's own personality, for otherwise the repressed desires will
get in the way in a most serious manner, and overthrow us
just in that place where we are most vulnerable. It is surely
better that a man learn to tolerate himself, and instead of
making war on himself convert his inner difficulties into real
experiences, rather than uselessly repeat them again and
again in phantasy. Then at least he lives, and does not
merely consume himself in fruitless struggles. But when
men are educated to recognise the baser side of their own
natures, it may be hoped they will learn to understand and
love their fellow-men better too. A decrease of hypocrisy
and an increase of tolerance towards oneself, can have
only good results in tolerance towards one's neighbours,
for men are only too easily disposed to extend to others
the unfairness and violence which they do to their own
natures.</p>

<p>Freud's theory of repression does, indeed, seem to
postulate the existence only of people who, being too moral,
are continually repressing the immorality of their natural
instincts. According to this idea, the immoral man who
allows his natural instincts an unbridled existence should be
proof against neurosis. But daily experience proves this is
obviously not the case; he may be just as neurotic as other
men. If we analyse him, we find that it is simply his
decency that has been repressed. Therefore, when an
immoral man is neurotic, he represents what Nietzsche
appropriately described as "the pale criminal," a man who
does not stand upon the same level as his deed.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>The opinion may be held, that in such a case the repressed
remnants of decency are merely infantile traditional legacies,
that impose unnecessary fetters upon natural instincts, for
which reason they should be eradicated. The principle
"écraser l'infâme" would be the natural culmination of
such an absolute let-instinct-live theory.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> That would
obviously be quite phantastic and nonsensical. It should,
indeed, never be forgotten&mdash;and the Freudian School needs
this reminder&mdash;that morality was not brought down upon
tables of stone from Sinai and forced upon the people, but
that morality is a function of the human soul, which is as
old as humanity itself. Morality is not inculcated from without.
Man has it primarily within himself&mdash;not the law
indeed, but the essence of morals.</p>

<p>After all, does a more moral view-point exist than the
let-instinct-live theory? Is there a more heroic morality
than this? That is why Nietzsche, the heroic, is especially
partial to it. It is natural and inborn cowardice that
makes people say, "God preserve me from following my
instincts," thinking that they thus prove their high moral
standard. They do not understand that following one's
bent is really much too costly for them, too strenuous, too
dangerous, and finally it cuts somewhat against that sense of
decency which most people associate rather with taste than
with a categorical imperative. The unpardonable fault of
the let-instinct-live theory is, that it is much too heroic, too
idealogic for the multitude.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, probably no other way for the immoral
man but to accept the moral corrective of his unconscious,
just as he who is moral must come to terms as
best he may, with his demons of the netherworld. It cannot
be gainsaid that the Freudian School is so convinced of
the fundamental, and even exclusive importance of sexuality
in neurosis, that it has been courageous enough to face
the consequences of its convictions by heroically attacking
the sexual morality of the present day. Many different
opinions prevail upon this subject. What is significant is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
that the problem of sexual morality is being widely discussed
at the present time. This is doubtless both useful
and necessary, for hitherto we have not really had any
sexual morality at all, but merely a low barbaric view,
quite insufficiently differentiated. In the Middle Ages,
usury was considered absolutely despicable, for at that
time the morality of finance was not casuistically differentiated;
there was nothing but a kind of lump-morality.
So nowadays, there exists nothing but sexual morality in
the lump. A girl who has an illegitimate child is condemned,
without any inquiry as to whether she is a decent person
or not. Any form of love that has no legal sanction is
immoral, no matter whether it occurs between thoughtful
people of value or irresponsible scamps. People are still
barbarically hypnotised by the thing itself, to such an
extent that they forget the individual.</p>

<p>Therefore the discussion of and attack upon sexual
morality of the present day signifies at bottom, a moral
deed, constraining people towards a differentiated and really
ethical conception of the subject.</p>

<p>As already stated, Freud sees the great conflict between
the ego and natural instinct chiefly under its sexual aspect.
This aspect does exist, but a big query should be placed
behind its actuality. The question is whether what appears
in a sexual form must always essentially be sexuality? It
is conceivable that one instinct may disguise itself under
another. Freud himself has supplied several notable instances
of such a disguise, proving therewith, convincingly, that many
of the deeds and aims of human kind are, at bottom, nothing
but somewhat figurative expressions substituted, on account
of embarrassment, in place of important elementary things.
The substitution is not seen through on account of reasons
of mutual consideration. There is nothing to hinder certain
elementary things being also pushed conveniently into the
foreground, in place of more necessary but less pleasant
ones, under the illusion that the elementary things only are
really in question.</p>

<p><em>The theory of sexuality although one-sided is absolutely right</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
<em>up to a certain point. It would, therefore, be just as false to
repudiate it as to accept it as universally valid.</em></p>


<p class="p3">III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The other Viewpoint: the Will to Power.</span></p>

<p>We have so far considered the problem of the psychology
of unconscious processes mainly from the point of view of
Freud. We have thereby doubtless gained an inkling of a
real truth, which perhaps our pride, our consciousness of
civilisation, tries to deny, although something else in us
affirms it. This situation is extremely irritating to some
people, arousing resistances, and at the same time they
are terror-stricken by it, a fact which they are most
unwilling to acknowledge. There is something terrible in
admitting this conflict, for it is an acknowledgment of being
swayed by instinct. Has it ever been understood what
it means to confess to the sway of instinct? Nietzsche
desired to be so swayed and advocated it most seriously.
He even sacrificed himself throughout his whole life, with
rare passion, to the idea of the Superman, that is to the
idea of the man who, obeying his instincts, transcends even
his very self. And what was the course of his life? It
turned out as Nietzsche himself prophesied in the passage in
"Zarathustra" relating to the fatal fall of the rope-dancer,
of the man who did not want to be "surpassed." Zarathustra
says to the dying rope-dancer: "Thy soul will be
dead even sooner than thy body." And later, the dwarf says
to Zarathustra: "Oh, Zarathustra, thou stone of wisdom!
Thou threwest thyself high, but every thrown-stone must
fall! Condemned of thyself, and to thine own stoning: oh,
Zarathustra, far indeed threwest thou the stone&mdash;but upon
<em>thyself</em> will it recoil!"</p>

<p>When he cried his "ecce homo" over himself, it was
again too late, and the crucifixion of the soul began even
before the body was dead. He who thus taught <em>yea-saying</em>
to the instincts of life, must have his own career looked
at critically, in order to discover the effects of this teaching
upon the teacher. But if we consider his life from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
this point of view, we must say that Nietzsche lived <em>beyond
instinct</em>, in the lofty atmosphere of heroic "sublimity."
This height could only be maintained by means of most
careful diet, choice climate and above all by many opiates.
Finally, the tension of this living shattered his brain. He
spoke of yea-saying, but lived the nay. His horror of people,
especially of the animal man, who lives by instinct, was too
great. He could not swallow the toad of which he so often
dreamt, and which he feared he must yet gulp down. The
Zarathustrian lion roared all the "higher" men, who craved
for life, back into the cavernous depths of the unconscious.
That is why his life does not convince us of the truth of his
teaching. The "higher man" should be able to sleep
without chloral, and be competent to live in Naumburg or
Basle despite "the fogs and shadows." He wants woman
and offspring; he needs to feel he has some value and
position in the herd, he longs for innumerable commonplaces,
and not least for what is humdrum: it is this instinct
that Nietzsche did not recognise; it is, in other words, the
natural animal instinct for life.</p>

<p>But how did he live if it was not from natural impulse?
Should Nietzsche really be accused of a practical denial of
his natural instincts? He would hardly agree to that;
indeed he might even prove, and that without difficulty,
that he really was following his instincts in the highest
sense. But we may well ask how is it possible that human
instincts could have led him so far from humanity, into
absolute isolation, into an aloofness from the herd which
he supported with loathing and disgust? One would have
thought that instinct would have united, would have coupled
and begot, that it would tend towards pleasure and good
cheer, towards gratification of all sensual desires. But we
have quite overlooked the fact that this is only one of the
possible directions of instinct. There exists not only the
instinct for the preservation of the species (the sexual
instinct), but also the instinct for the preservation of the self.</p>

<p>Nietzsche obviously speaks of this latter instinct, that is
of <em>the will to power</em>. Whatever other kinds of instinct may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
exist are for him only a consequence of the will to power.
Viewed from the standpoint of Freud's sexual-psychology
this is a gross error, a misconception of biology, a bad
choice made by a decadent neurotic human being. For it
would be easy for any adherent of sexual psychology to
prove that all that was too lofty, too heroic, in Nietzsche's
conception of the world and of life, was nothing but a consequence
of the repression and misconception of "instinct,"
that is of the instinct that <em>this</em> psychology considers
fundamental.</p>

<p>This brings us to the <em>question of perception</em>, or rather it
were better to say of the various lenses through which the
world may be perceived. For it would hardly be permissible
to pronounce a judgment on a life like Nietzsche's. It was
lived with rare consistency, from the beginning to the fateful
end, in accordance with his underlying natural fundamental
instinct for power. It would hardly do to pronounce it to be
merely figurative, otherwise we should make the same unjust
condemnation that Nietzsche pronounced upon his polar
opposite Richard Wagner, of whom he said, "<em>Everything in
him is false</em>; what is genuine is hidden or disguised. He is
an actor, in every bad and good meaning of the word."
Why this judgment? Wagner is a precise representative of
that other fundamental instinct, which Nietzsche overlooked,
and upon which Freud's psychology is based. If we inquire
whether the other main instinct&mdash;that of power&mdash;was unconsidered
by Freud, we shall find that he has included it
under the name of the "ego instinct." But these ego
instincts drag out an obscure existence, according to his
psychology, alongside the broad, all-too-broad, development
of the sexual theme. In reality, however, human nature
wages a cruel and hardly-to-be-ended warfare between the
ego-principle and that of formless instinct. The ego is all
barriers; instinct, on the other hand, is without any limits.
Both principles are equally powerful. In a certain sense
men may account themselves fortunate in being conscious of
only one instinct: therefore he who is wise avoids getting
to know the other. But if, after all, he does get to know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
other instinct, he is indeed a lost man. For then he enters
upon the Faustian conflict. Goethe has shown us in the
first part of "Faust" what the acceptance of instinct
involves, and in the second part, what the acceptance of the
ego and of his gruesome unconscious world would signify.
Everything that is insignificant, <em>petty</em>, and cowardly in us
shrinks from it, and would avoid it&mdash;and there is one
admirable means of doing so. Namely, by discovering that
the other thing in us is "another fellow," a live man who
actually thinks, feels, does and desires all the things that are
despicable and odious. In this way the bogey is seized, and
the battle against him is begun to our satisfaction. Hence
arise, also, those chronic idiosyncrasies of which the history
of morals has preserved a few examples for us. The instance
of Nietzsche contra Wagner, already cited, is particularly
transparent. But ordinary human life is crammed full of
such cases. It is by these ingenuous devices that man saves
himself from the Faustian catastrophe for which he
evidently lacks both courage and strength. But a sincere
man knows that even his bitterest opponent, or any number
of them, does not by any means equal his one worst
adversary, that is his other self who "bides within his
breast." Nietzsche unconsciously had Wagner <em>in himself</em>,
that is why he envied him his Parsifal. But even worse, he
was a Saul and also had Paul within. That is why Nietzsche
became a stigmatised outcast of the Spirit; he had like
Saul to experience Christification when "the other self"
inspired him with his "ecce homo." Which man in him
"broke down before the cross," Wagner or Nietzsche?</p>

<p>It was ordained by destiny that one of Freud's earliest
pupils, Adler,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> should formulate a view of neurosis as founded
exclusively upon the principle of power. It is interesting
and even fascinating to observe how totally different the
same things appear when viewed in another light. In order
to emphasise the main contrast, I would like at once to
draw attention to the fact that, according to Freud, everything
is a strictly causal consequence of previously-occurring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
facts; Adler, on the contrary, sees everything as a
finally conditioned arrangement. To take a simple example:
A young woman begins to have attacks of terror. She
wakes at night from some nightmare with a piercing cry;
calming herself with difficulty, she clings to her husband, imploring
him not to leave her, making him repeat again and
again that he loves her, etc. Gradually a nervous asthma
develops, attacks of which also come on during the day.</p>

<p>In such a case, the Freudian system begins at once to
burrow in the inner causality of the illness: What did the
initial anxiety-dreams contain. She recalls wild bulls,
lions, tigers, bad men. What does the patient associate with
them? She told a story of something that had happened to
her when she was still single. It ran as follows: She was
staying at a summer-resort in the mountains, a great deal of
tennis was played, the usual acquaintances being made.
There was a young Italian who played particularly well,
and who also knew how to handle the guitar in the evenings.
A harmless flirtation developed, leading once to a moon-light
walk. On this occasion, the Italian temperament "unexpectedly"
broke through, running away with the young
man to the great terror of the unsuspecting girl. He
"looked at her with such a look," that she could never
forget it. This look follows her even in her dreams; the
wild animals that persecuted her had it. As a matter of fact,
does this look originally come from the Italian? Another
reminiscence enlightens us. The patient had lost her father
through an accident, when she was about fourteen years old.
The father was a man of the world, and travelled a great
deal. Not long before his death he took her to Paris, where,
among other things, they visited the <em>Follies Bergères</em>. Something
happened there that at the time made a deep impression
upon her. As they were leaving the theatre, a rouged
female suddenly pressed close up to her father in an
impertinent way. She looked at her father in fear as to
what he would do&mdash;and then she saw that look, that animal
glare in his eyes. An inexplicable something clung to her
day and night. From this moment her attitude to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
father was quite changed. At one instant she was irritable
and full of venomous moods, at another she loved him extravagantly;
then causeless fits of crying suddenly began,
and, for a time, whenever her father was at home, she was
tormented by terrible choking at table, with apparent attacks
of suffocation, which were usually followed by voicelessness
lasting from one to two days. When the news of her
father's sudden death arrived, she was overcome by uncontrolled
grief ending in hysterical laughter. But she
soon calmed down, her condition improving quickly, and
the neurotic symptoms disappearing almost completely. It
seemed as if a veil of forgetfulness had descended over the
past. Only the experience with the Italian roused something
in her of which she was afraid. She had broken off completely
with the young man. A few years later she married.
The present neurosis only began after the birth of her second
child, that is at the moment when she discovered that
her husband took a certain tender interest in another
woman.</p>

<p>This history raises a number of questions. For instance,
what do we know about the mother? It should be said of
her that she was very nervous, and had tried many kinds of
sanatoria and systems of cure. She also had symptoms of
fear and nervous asthma. The relations between her and
her husband had been very strained as far back as the
patient could remember. The mother did not understand
the father; the daughter always felt that she understood
him better. She was moreover her father's declared favourite,
being inwardly correspondingly cool towards her mother.</p>

<p>These facts are indications for a survey of the meaning
of the illness. Behind the present symptoms phantasies are
operative, connected in the first place with the young Italian,
but further clearly referring to the father, whose unhappy
marriage furnished the little daughter with an early opportunity
of acquiring a position that really should have been
filled by her mother. Behind this conquest there lies, of
course, a phantasy of being the woman who was really suited
to her father. The first attack of neurosis broke out at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
moment when this phantasy received a violent shock, presumably
similar to that the mother had once experienced (a
fact that was, however, unknown to the child). The symptoms
are easily comprehensible as the expression of disappointed
and rejected love. The choking is based upon a sensation
of tightening in the throat that is a well-known accompanying
phenomenon of violent effects which we cannot quite
"swallow." The metaphors of language often refer to similar
physiological occurrences. When the father died, it seemed
that her consciousness sorrowed deeply but her unconscious
laughed, after the manner of Till Eulenspiegel, who was
sad when he went downhill but was jolly when climbing
laboriously, happy in anticipation of what was coming.
When the father was at home the girl was low-spirited
and ill, but whenever he was away she felt much better.
Herein she resembles numerous husbands and wives who
as yet are mutually hiding from each other the secret that
they are not under all circumstances indispensable to one
another.</p>

<p>That the unconscious had some right to laugh was
shown by the subsequent period of good health. She succeeded
in letting all that had passed retire behind the trap-door.
The experience with the Italian, however, threatened
to bring the netherworld up again. But she quickly pulled
the handle and shut the door. She remained quite well until
the dragon of neurosis came creeping in, just when she
imagined herself to be already safely out of her troubles, in
the so-to-say perfected state of wife and mother. Sexual
psychology finds the cause of the neurosis in the fact that
the patient is not at bottom free from the father. This
forces her to resuscitate her former experience at the moment
when she discovered in the Italian the very same disturbing
something that had formerly made such a deep impression
upon her when perceived in her father. These recollections
were naturally revived by the analogous experience with
another man, and formed the starting-point of the neurosis.
It might therefore be said that the content and cause of the
neurosis lay in the conflict between the phantastic infantile-erotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
relation to the father on the one hand, and her love
for the husband on the other.</p>

<p>But if we now consider the course of the same illness
from the standpoint of the other instinct, that is, of the will
to power, a different complexion is put upon the matter.
Her parents' unhappy marriage afforded an excellent opportunity
for the exhibition of childish instinct for power. The
instinct for power desires that, under all circumstances, the
ego should be "on top," whether by straight or crooked
means. At all costs the integrity of the personality must be
preserved.</p>

<p>Every attempt, even what appears to be an attempt of
the surroundings, to bring about the slightest subjection of
the individual, is retorted to by the "masculine protest," as
Adler expresses it. The mother's disappointment and her
taking refuge in a neurosis brought about an opportunity for
the development of power and the attainment of a dominating
position. Love and excellence of conduct are, as everybody
knows, extremely well-adapted weapons for the purposes
of the instinct for power. Virtue is not seldom made the
means of <em>forcing</em> recognition from others. Already as a child
she knew how to obtain a privileged position with her father
by means of specially pleasing and amiable behaviour,
even occasionally to supplant her mother. This was
not out of love for her father, although love was a good
means of obtaining the coveted superiority. The hysterical
laughter at the death of her father is a striking proof of this
fact. One is inclined to consider such an explanation as a
deplorable depreciation of love, if not actually a malicious
insinuation. But let us pause a moment, reflect, and look
at the world as it really is. Have we never seen those innumerable
people who love, and believe in their love, only until
its purpose is achieved, and who then turn away as if they
had never loved? And, after all, does not Nature herself do
the same? In fact, is a "purposeless" love possible? If
so, it belongs to the highest human virtues, which confessedly
are extremely rare. Perhaps there is a general disposition to
reflect as little as possible about the nature and purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
love; discoveries might be made which would show the value
of one's own love to be less considerable than we had supposed.
However, it were dangerous to life to subtract anything from
the value of fundamental instincts, perhaps specially so
to-day, when we seem to have only a minimum of values left.</p>

<p>So the patient had an attack of hysterical laughter at the
death of her father; she had finally arrived at the top. It
was hysterical laughter, therefore a psychogenic symptom,
that is, something proceeding from unconscious motives and
not from those of the conscious ego. That is a difference
that should not be underrated, for it enables us to recognise
whence and how human virtues arise. Their contraries led
to hell, that is, in modern terms, to the unconscious, where
the counterparts of our conscious virtue have long been
gathering. That is why our very virtue makes us desire to
know nothing of the unconscious; indeed, it is even the
summit of virtuous wisdom to maintain that there is no unconscious
at all. But unfortunately we are all in a like predicament
with Brother Medardus in E. T. A. Hoffman's "The
Elixir of the Devil": somewhere or other there exists a
sinister, terrible brother, our own incarnate counterpart
bound to us by flesh and blood, who comprehends everything,
maliciously hoarding whatever we most desire should disappear
beneath the table.</p>

<p>The first outbreak of neurosis occurred in our patient at
the moment when she became aware of the fact that there
was something in her father which she did not control. And
then it dawned upon her of what use her mother's neurosis
was. When one meets with an obstacle that cannot be overcome
by sensible and charming means, there yet exists an
arrangement hitherto unknown to her which her mother had
been beforehand in discovering, and that is neurosis. That
is the reason why she now imitates her mother. But, the
astonished reader asks, what is supposed to be the use of
neurosis? What does it effect? Whoever has had a pronounced
case of neurosis in his immediate environment,
knows all that can be "effected" by a neurosis. In fact,
there is altogether no better means of tyrannising over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
whole household than by a striking neurosis. Heart attacks,
choking fits, convulsions of all kinds achieve enormous effects,
that can hardly be surpassed. Picture the fountains of pity
let loose, the sublime anxiety of the dear kind parents, the
hurried running to and fro of the servants, the incessant
sounding of the call to the telephone, the hasty arrival of
the physicians, the delicacy of the diagnosis, the detailed
examinations, the lengthy courses of treatment, the considerable
expense; and there, in the midst of all the uproar,
lies the innocent sufferer, to whom the household is even
overflowingly grateful, when he has recovered from the
"spasms."</p>

<p>The girl discovered this incomparable "arrangement"
(to use Adler's term), applying it on occasion when the father
was there with success. It became unnecessary when the
father died, for now she was finally uppermost. The Italian
was soon dismissed, because he laid too much stress upon
her femininity by an inopportune reminder of his manliness.
When the way opened to the possibility of a suitable marriage,
she loved, adapting herself without any complaint to the
deplorable rôle of the queen bee. As long as she held the
position of admired superiority, everything went splendidly.
But when her husband evinced a small outside interest, she
was obliged again to have recourse to the extremely efficacious
"arrangement," that is, to the indirect application of power,
because she had once again come upon that thing&mdash;this time
in her husband&mdash;that had already previously withdrawn her
father from her influence.</p>

<p>That is how the matter appears from the standpoint of
the psychology of power. I fear that the reader will feel as
did the Kadi, before whom the counsel of one party spoke
first. When he had ended, the Kadi said: "Thou hast
spoken well. I perceive that thou art right." Then spoke
the counsel for the other party, and when he had ended, the
Kadi scratched himself behind his ear and said: "Thou hast
spoken well. I perceive that thou also art right." There is
no doubt that the instinct for power plays a most extraordinary
part. It is true that the complexes of neurotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
symptoms are also exquisite "arrangements," that inexorably
realise their aims with incredible obstinacy and unequalled
cunning. The neurosis is final; that is, it is directed towards
an aim. Adler merits considerable distinction for having
demonstrated this.</p>

<p>Which of the two points of view is right? That is a
question that might well cause much brain-racking. For the
two explanations cannot be simply combined, being absolutely
contradictory. In one case, it is love and its course that is
the principal and decisive fact; and in the other case, it is
the power of the ego. In the first case the ego is merely a
kind of appendage to the passion for love; and in the second
love is upon occasion merely a means to the end, that of
gaining the upper hand. Whoever has the power of the ego
most at heart rebels against the former conception, whilst he
who cares most about love, will never be able to be reconciled
to the latter.</p>


<p class="p3">IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Two Types of Psychology.</span></p>

<p>It is at this point that our most recent researches may
suitably be introduced. We have found, in the first place,
that there are two types of human psychology.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> In the one
type the fundamental function is feeling, and in the other it
is thought. The one feels his way into the object, the other
thinks about it. The one adapts himself to his surroundings
by feeling, thinking coming later; whilst the other adapts
himself by means of thought, preceded by understanding.
The one who feels his way transfers himself to some extent
to the object; whilst the other withdraws himself from the
object to some extent, or pauses before it and reflects about
it. The first we called the <em>extroverted</em> type, because in the
main he goes outside himself to the object, the latter is
called the <em>introverted</em> type, because in a major degree he
turns away from the object, withdrawing into himself and
thinking about it.</p>

<p>These remarks only give the broadest outline of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
types. But even this quite inadequate sketch enables us to
recognise that the two theories are the outcome of the contrast
between the two types. The sexual theory is promulgated
from the standpoint of feeling, the power theory from
that of thought; for the extrovert always places the accent
upon the feelings that are connected with the object, whereas
the introvert always puts the accent upon the ego, and is as
much detached by thought from the object as possible.</p>

<p><em>The irreconcilable contradictions of the two theories are now
to be understood, because both theories are the product of a one-sided
psychology.</em> We find an instance of the contrast of
types in Nietzsche and Wagner. The dissension between
the two is due to the contrast in their ideas of psychological
values. What is most prized by the one is "affectation"
for the other, and is deemed false to the very core. Each
depreciates the other.</p>

<p>If we apply the sexual theory to an extrovert it tallies
with the facts of the case; but if we apply it to an introvert,
we simply maltreat and do violence to his psychology. The
same applies to the contrary case. The relative rightness of
the two hostile theories is explained by the fact that each one
draws its material from cases that prove the correctness of
the theory. There is a remnant of persons whom neither
theory fits&mdash;has not every rule its exceptions?</p>

<p>Criticism of both theories is indispensable. Recognition
of facts showed the necessity of overcoming their contrast,
and of evolving a theory that should do justice not only to
one or the other type, but equally to both.</p>

<p>Even the layman will to some extent have been struck by
the fact that in spite of their correctness both theories really
have a very unpleasant character and one not altogether
pertinent under all circumstances to the strict views of
science. The sexual theory is unæsthetic and unsatisfying
intellectually. The power theory, on the other hand, is
decidedly venomous. Both inevitably reduce high-flown
ideals, heroic attitudes, pathos, and deep convictions, in a
painful manner to a reality which is hackneyed and trite;
that is, if these theories are applied to such things&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
they should certainly not be so applied. Both theories are
really only therapeutic instruments out of the tool-chest of
the physician, whose sharp and merciless knife cuts out all
that is pernicious and diseased. It was just such a misapplication
of theory Nietzsche tried with his destructive
criticism of ideals. He regarded ideals as rampant diseases
of the soul of humanity; as indeed they really are. However,
in the hands of a good physician who really knows the
human soul, who, as Nietzsche says, "has a finger for the
slightest shade," who applies the treatment only to what is
really diseased in a soul&mdash;in such hands both theories prove
wholesome caustics. The application must be adapted to the
individual case. It is a dangerous therapy in the hands of
those who do not understand how to deal out the treatment.
These applications of criticism do good when there is something
that should and must be destroyed, dissolved or brought
low, but can easily damage what is being built up, or growing
in response to life's requirements.</p>

<p>Both theories might, therefore, be allowed to pass without
attack, in so far as they, like medicinal poisons, are entrusted
to the safe hands of the physician. But fate has ordained
that they should not remain solely in the care of those who
are qualified to use them. First of all they naturally became
known to the medical public. Every practising physician
has an indefinitely high percentage of neurotics among his
patients; he is therefore more or less obliged to look out for
new and suitable systems of treatment. He ultimately lights
upon the difficult method of psychoanalysis. He is at first
not competent for this, for how should he have learnt about
the secrets of the human soul? Certainly not through his
academic studies. The smattering of psychiatry that he
acquired for his examination barely suffices to enable him to
recognise the symptoms of the commonest mental disturbances,
and is far from giving him any sufficient insight into
the human soul. He is, therefore, practically quite unprepared
to apply the analytic method. An unusually far-reaching
knowledge of the soul is indeed necessary in order
to be able to apply this caustic treatment with advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
One must be in a position to differentiate elements that are
diseased and should be discarded, from those which are
valuable and should be retained. This is plainly a matter of
great difficulty. Any one who wishes to get a vivid impression
of the way in which a psychologysing physician may
unwarrantably violate a patient through an ignoble pseudo-scientific
prejudice, should read what Moebius has written
about Nietzsche. Or he may study various psychiatric
writings about the "case of Christ," and will surely not
hesitate to lament the lot of the patient whose fate it is to
meet with such "understanding." Psychoanalysis&mdash;greatly
to the regret of the medical man who, however, had not
accepted it&mdash;then passed over into the hands of the teaching
profession. This is right: for it is really, when rightly
understood and handled, an educational method, and one of
the social sciences. I would, however, never personally recommend
that Freud's purely sexual analysis should be exclusively
applied as an educational method. It might do much harm
because of its one-sidedness. In order to make psychoanalysis
available for educational purposes, all the metamorphoses
that have been the work of the last few years were
needed. The method had to be expanded from a general
psychological point of view.</p>

<p>But the two theories of which I have spoken are not
general theories. They are, as I have said, caustics to be
applied, so to say, "locally," for they are both destructive
and reductive. They explain to the patient that his symptoms
come from here or there, and are "nothing but" this or
that. It would be very unjust to wish to maintain that this
reductive theory is wrong in a given case, but when exalted
into a general explanation of the nature of the soul&mdash;whether
sick or healthy&mdash;<em>a reductive theory becomes impossible</em>. For
the human soul, whether it be sick or healthy, cannot be
<em>merely</em> reductively explained. Sexuality it is true is always
and everywhere present; the instinct for power certainly
does penetrate the heights and the depths of the soul; but
the soul itself is not solely either the one or the other, or
even both together, it is also that which it has made and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
make out of them both. A person is only half understood
when one knows how everything in him came about. Only
a dead man can be explained in terms of the past, a living
one must be otherwise explained. Life is not made up of
yesterdays only, nor is it understood nor explained by
reducing to-day to yesterday. Life has also a to-morrow,
and to-day is only understood if we are able to add the
indications of to-morrow to our knowledge of what was
yesterday. This holds good for all expressions of psychological
life, even for symptoms of disease. Symptoms of
neurosis are not merely consequences of causes that once
have been, whether they were "infantile sexuality" or "infantile
instinct for power." They are endeavours towards a
new synthesis of life. It must immediately be added, however,
they are endeavours that have miscarried. None the
less they are attempts; they represent the germinal striving
which has both meaning and value. They are embryos that
failed to achieve life, owing to unpropitious conditions of an
internal and external nature.</p>

<p>The reader will now probably propound the question:
What possible value and meaning can a neurosis have? Is
it not a most useless and repulsive pest of humanity? Can
being nervous do anybody good? Possibly, in a way similar
to that of flies and other vermin, which were created by
God in order that man might exercise the useful virtue of
patience. Stupid as this thought is from the standpoint of
natural science, it might be quite shrewd from that of psychology;
that is, if we substitute "nervous symptoms" in
the place of "vermin." Even Nietzsche, who had an uncommon
disdain for anything stupid and trite in thought,
more than once acknowledged how much he owed to his
illness. I have known more than one person who attributed
all his usefulness, and the justification for his existence even,
to a neurosis, that hindered all decisive stupidities of his life,
<em>compelling</em> him to lead an existence which developed what
was valuable in him; material that would have been crushed
had not the neurosis with its iron grip forced the man to
keep to the place where he really belonged. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
people the meaning of whose life&mdash;whose real significance&mdash;lies
in the unconscious; in consciousness lies only all that is
vain and delusive. With others the reverse is the case, and
for them the neurosis has another significance. An extended
reduction is appropriate to the one, but emphatically unsuitable
to the other.</p>

<p>The reader will now, indeed, be inclined to agree to the
possibility of certain cases of neurosis having such a significance
but will nevertheless be ready to deny an expediency
that is so far-reaching and full of meaning to ordinary cases
of this illness. What value, for instance, might there be in
the afore-mentioned case of asthma and hysterical attacks of
fear? I confess that the value here is not so obvious, especially
if the case be looked at from the standpoint of a reductive
theory, that is, from that of a <em>chronique scandaleuse</em> of
the psychological development of an individual.</p>

<p>We perceive that both the theories hitherto discussed
have this one point in common, viz. they relentlessly disclose
everything that is valueless in people. They are
theories, or rather hypotheses, which explain wherein the
cause of the sickness lies. They are accordingly concerned
not with the <em>values</em> of a person, but with his lack of value
that makes itself evident in a disturbing way. From this
point of view, it is possible to be reconciled to both standpoints.</p>

<p>A "value" is a possibility by means of which energy may
attain development. But in so far as a negative value is also
a possibility through which energy may attain development&mdash;as
may, for instance, be clearly seen in the very considerable
manifestations of energy shown in neurosis&mdash;it also stands
for a value, albeit it brings about manifestations of energy
which are useless and harmful. In itself energy is neither
useful nor harmful, neither full of value nor lacking in it; it
is indifferent, everything depending upon the <em>form</em> into which
it enters. The form gives the quality to the energy. On
the other side, mere form without energy is also indifferent.
Therefore in order to bring about a positive value, on the one
hand energy is necessary, and upon the other a valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
form. In a neurosis psychic energy is undoubtedly present,
but in an inferior and not realisable form. Both the analytic
methods that have been discussed above are of service only
as solvents of this inferior form. They prove themselves
good here as caustics.</p>

<p>By these methods we gain energy that is certainly free,
but which, being as yet unapplied, is indifferent. Hitherto
the supposition prevailed, that this newly acquired energy
was at the patient's conscious disposal, that he might apply
it in any way he liked. In so far as it was thought that the
energy was nothing but the sexual impulse, people spoke of
a sublimated application of the same, under the presumption
that the patient could, without further ado, transfer what
was thought of as sexual energy into a "sublimation"; that
is, into a non-sexual form of use. It might, for instance, be
transferred to the cultivation of an art, or to some other good
or useful activity. According to this concept, the patient
had the possibility of deciding, either arbitrarily or from
inclination, how his energy should be sublimated.</p>

<p>This conception may be accorded a justification for its
existence, in so far as it is at all possible for a human being
to assign a definite direction to his life, in which its course
should run. But we know that there is no human forethought
nor philosophy which can enable us to give our lives
a prescribed direction, except for quite a short distance.
Destiny lies before us, perplexing us, and teeming with
possibilities, and yet only one of these many possibilities is
our own particular right way. Who should presume to
designate the one possibility beforehand, even though he
have the most complete knowledge of his own character that
a man can have? Much can certainly be attained by means
of will-power. But having regard to the fate of certain
personalities with particularly strong wills, it is entirely
misleading for us to want at all costs to change our own fate
by power of will. Our will is a function that is directed
by our <em>powers of reflection</em>; it depends, therefore, upon how
our powers of reflection are constituted. In order to deserve
its name reflection must be <em>rational</em>, that is, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
reason. But has it ever been proved, or can it ever be
proved, that life and destiny harmonise with our human
reason, that is, that they are exclusively rational? On the
contrary, we have ground for supposing that they are also
irrational, that is to say, that in the last resort they too are
based in regions beyond the human reason. The irrationality
of the great process is shown by its so-called <em>accidentalness</em>,
which perforce we ought to deny, since, obviously, we cannot
think of a process not being causally and necessarily conditioned.
But actually, accidentality exists everywhere, and
does so indeed so obtrusively that we might as well pocket
our causal philosophy! The rich store of life both is, and
is not, determined by law; it is at the same time rational
and irrational. Therefore, the reason and the will founded
upon it are only valid for a short distance. The further we
extend this rationally chosen direction, the surer we may be
that we are thereby excluding the irrational possibilities of
life, which have, however, just as good a right to be lived.
Aye, we even injure ourselves, since we cut off the wealth of
accidental eventualities by a too rigid and conscious direction.
It was certainly very expedient for man to be able to give his
life a direction; it would, therefore, be quite right to maintain
that the attainment of reasonableness was the greatest
achievement of mankind. But that is not to say that under
all circumstances, this must or will always continue to be
the case. The present fearful catastrophic world-war has
tremendously upset the most optimistic upholder of rationalism
and culture.</p>

<p>In 1913 Ostwald wrote<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> as follows: "The whole world
agrees that the present state of armed peace is untenable,
and is gradually becoming an impossible condition. It
demands tremendous sacrifices from individual nations far
surpassing the outlay for cultural purposes, without any
positive values being gained thereby. Therefore, if mankind
could discover ways and means of putting an end to these
preparations for a war <em>that will never come</em>, this conscripting
of a considerable part of the nation at the best and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
capable age for training for war purposes, if it could overcome
all the innumerable other injuries caused by the present
customs, such an enormous saving of energy would be effected,
that an undreamt-of development of the evolution of culture
might be expected. For like a hand-to-hand fight, war is the
oldest, and also the most unsuitable of all possible means of
solving a conflict between wills, being indeed accompanied by
the most deplorable waste of energy. The complete setting
aside of potential as well as of actual warfare is, therefore,
absolutely one of the most important tasks of culture in our
time, a real necessity from the point of view of energy."</p>

<p>But the irrationality of destiny ordained otherwise than
the rationality of the well-meaning thinker; since it not only
determined to use the piled-up weapons and soldiers, but
much more than that, it brought about a tremendous insane
devastation and unparalleled slaughter. From this catastrophe
humanity may possibly draw the conclusion, that only
one side of fate can be mastered by rational intention.</p>

<p>What can be said of mankind in general applies also to
individuals, for mankind as a whole consists of nothing but
individuals. And whatever the psychology of mankind is,
that is also the psychology of the individual. We are
experiencing in the world-war a fearful balancing-up with
the rational intentionality of organised culture. What is
called "will" in the individual, is termed "imperialism"
among nations, for the will is a demonstration of power over
fate, that is, exclusion of what is accidental. The organisation
of culture is a rational and "expedient" sublimation
of free and indifferent energies, brought about by design and
intention. The same is the case in the individual. And
just as the hope of a universal international organisation
of culture has experienced a cruel right-about through this
war, so also must the individual, in the course of his life,
often find that so-called "disposable" energies do not suffer
themselves to be disposed of.</p>

<p>I was once consulted by a business man of about forty-five,
whose case is a good illustration of the foregoing. He
was a typical American self-made man, who had worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
himself up from the bottom. He had been successful, and
had founded a very extensive business. He had also gradually
organised the business in such a way that he could
now retire from its management. He had indeed resigned
two years before I saw him. Until then he had only
lived for his business, concentrating all his energy upon it,
with that incredible intensity and one-sidedness that is so
peculiar to the successful American man of business. He
had bought himself a splendid country seat, where he
thought he would "live," which he imagined to mean
keeping horses, automobiles, playing golf and tennis, attending
and giving parties, etc. But he had reckoned without
his host. The energy that had become "disposable"
did not enter into these tempting prospects, but betook
itself capriciously to quite other ways. A couple of weeks
after the commencement of his longed-for life of bliss, he
began to brood over peculiar vague physical sensations. A
few more weeks sufficed to plunge him into an unprecedented
state of hypochondria. His nerves broke down completely.
He, who was physically an uncommonly strong
and exceptionally energetic man, became like a whining
child. And that put an end to all his paradise. He fell
from one apprehension to another, worrying himself almost
to death. He then consulted a celebrated specialist, who
immediately perceived quite rightly that there was nothing
wrong with the man but lack of employment. The patient
saw the sense of this, and betook himself to his former
position. But to his great disappointment no interest for
his business presented itself. Neither the application of
patience nor determination availed to help. His energy
would not by any means be forced back into the business.
His condition naturally became worse than before. Energy
that hitherto had been actively creative was now turned
back into himself, with fearfully destructive force. His
creative genius rose up, so to speak, in revolt against him,
and instead of, as before, producing great organisations in
the world, his demon now created equally clever systems of
hypochondriac fallacies, by which the man was absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
crushed. When I saw him, he was already a hopeless moral
ruin. I tried to make clear to him that such a gigantic
amount of energy might indeed be withdrawn from business,
but the problem remained as to where it should go. The
finest horses, the fastest automobiles, and the most amusing
parties are in themselves no inducement for energy, although
it is certainly quite rational to think that a man who has
devoted his whole life to serious work, has a natural right
to enjoy himself. This would necessarily be the case if
things happened "humanly" in destiny; first would come
work, then well-earned leisure. But things happen irrationally
and inconveniently enough, energy requires a congenial
channel, otherwise it is dammed up and becomes
destructive. My arguments met with no response, as was
indeed to be expected. Such an advanced case can only be
taken care of till death; it cannot be cured.</p>

<p>This case clearly illustrates the fact that it does not lie in
our power to transfer a "disposable" energy to whatever
rationally chosen object we may like. Exactly the same may
be said of those apparently available energies that are made
available by the fact that the psychoanalytical caustic has
destroyed their unsuitable forms. These energies can be
arbitrarily applied, as has already been said, at the very most
only for a short time. They resist following the rationally
presented possibilities for any length of time. Psychic energy
is indeed a fastidious thing, that insists upon having its
own conditions fulfilled. There may be ever so much energy
existing, but we cannot make it useful, so long as we do not
succeed in finding a congenial channel for it.</p>

<p>The whole of my research work for the last years has
been concentrated upon this question. The <em>first stage</em> of this
work was to discover the extent to which the two theories
discussed above were tenable. The <em>second stage</em> consisted
in the recognition of the fact, that these two theories correspond
to two opposite psychological types, which I have
designated the introversion and the extroversion types.
William James<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
was struck by the existence of these two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
types among thinkers. He differentiated them as the "tough-minded,"
and the "tender-minded." Similarly, Ostwald<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
discovered an analogous difference in the classical and
romantic types among great scholars. I am not therefore
alone in my ideas about the types, as is testified by
mentioning only these two well-known names out of many
others. Historical researches have proved to me that not
a few of the great controversies in the history of thought
were based upon the contrast between the types. The
most significant case of this kind is the contrast between
nominalism and realism, which, beginning with the difference
between the Platonic and the Megarian schools,
descended to scholastic philosophy, where Abelard won the
immortal distinction of at least having ventured an attempt
to unite the two contradictory standpoints in conceptualism.
This conflict has continued down to the present day, where
it finds expression in the antagonism of spiritualism and
materialism.</p>

<p>Just as in the general history of thought, so too every
individual has a share in this contrast of types. Close
investigation proves that people of opposite types have an
unconscious predilection for marrying each other, that they
may mutually complement one another. Each type has
one function that is specially well developed, the introvert
using his thought as the function of adaptation, thinking
beforehand about how he shall act; whilst the extrovert, on
the contrary, feels his way into the object by acting. To
some extent he acts beforehand. Hence by daily application
the one has developed his thought, and the other his
feeling. In extreme cases the one limits himself to thinking
and observing, and the other to feeling and acting. It is
true that the introvert feels also, very deeply indeed, almost
too deeply; that is why an English investigator<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> has gone
so far as to describe his as "the emotional type." True,
the emotion is there, but it all remains inside, and the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
passionate and deeper his feeling is, the quieter is his
outward demeanour. As the proverb puts it, "Still waters
run deep." Similarly, the extrovert <em>thinks</em> also, but that
likewise mostly inside, whilst his feelings visibly go outside,
that is why he is held to be full of feeling whilst the introvert
is considered cold and dry. But as the feeling of the thinker
goes inwards, it is not developed as a function adapted to
external situations, but remains in a relatively undeveloped
state. Similarly the thinking of one who feels remains also
relatively undeveloped.</p>

<p>But if comparatively well-adapted individuals are under
consideration, then the introvert will normally be found to
have his feeling directed outwards, and the result may
be extraordinarily deceptive. He shows feelings; he is
amiable, sympathetic, even emotional. But a critical examination
of the expressions of his feelings reveals that they
are markedly conventional. They are not individualised.
He shows to every one, without any essential difference, the
same friendliness and the same sympathy; whilst the extrovert's
expressions of feeling are throughout delicately graded
and individualised. With the introvert the expression of
feelings is really a gesture that is artificially adopted and
conventional. Similarly, the extrovert may apparently think,
and that even very clearly and scientifically. But upon
closer investigation, his thoughts are found to be really
foreign property, merely conventional forms which have been
artificially acquired. They lack anything individual and
original, and are just as lukewarm and colourless as the
conventional feelings of the introvert. Under these conventional
disguises, quite other things are slumbering in
both, which occasionally when awakened by some overpowering
effect, suddenly break out to the astonishment and
horror of the environment.</p>

<p>Most civilised people incline more to one type than the
other. Taken together they would supplement each other
exceedingly well. That is why they are so apt to marry one
another, and so long as they are fully occupied with adapting
themselves to the necessities of life they suit one another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
splendidly. But if the man has earned a competence, or if
a big legacy drop from the sky, terminating the external
urgencies of life, then they have time to occupy themselves
with each other. Until now they stood back to back, defending
themselves against want. But now they turn to each
other expecting to understand one another; and they make
the discovery that they have never understood one another.
They speak different languages. Thus the conflict between
the two types of psychology begins. This conflict is venomous,
violent and full of mutual depreciation, even if it be conducted
very quietly in the utmost intimacy. <em>This is so because the
value of the one is the worthlessness of the other.</em> The one,
starting from the standpoint of his valuable thinking, takes
for granted that the feelings of the other correspond to his
own inferior feelings, this because he knows absolutely nothing
of any other feelings. But the other, starting from the standpoint
of his valuable feelings, assumes that his partner has the
same inferior thought that he himself has. Evidently there
is plenty of work here for Goethe's Homunculus, who had
to find out "why husband and wife get on so badly." Now
as many cases of neurosis have a basis in such differences,
I, as a physician, found myself obliged to relieve the Homunculus
of some of his ungrateful task. I am glad to be able
to say that many a sufferer has been helped in grave difficulties
by the enlightenment I could give.</p>

<p>The <em>third stage</em> of the path of increasing understanding
consisted in formulating a theory of the psychology of types
which would be of practical use for the development of man.
Viewed from the newly-gained standpoint, there resulted,
first of all, <em>a totally new theory of psychogenic disturbances</em>.</p>

<p>The foundation of the facts remains the same: the first
hypothesis of every neurosis is the existence of an unconscious
conflict. According to Freud's theory, this is an erotic
conflict, or to speak more exactly, a battle of the moral consciousness
against the unconscious infantile sexual world of
phantasy and its transference to external objects. According
to Adler's theory, it is a battle of the superiority of the ego
against all oppressive influences, whether from inside or outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>But the new idea asserts that <em>the neurotic conflict always
takes place between the adapted function and the co-function that
is undifferentiated, and that lies to a great extent in the unconscious</em>;
therefore in the case of the introvert, between thought
and unconscious feeling, but in that of the extrovert, between
feeling and unconscious thought.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Another theory of the
etiological moment results from this. If a man who naturally
adapts himself by thinking is faced by a demand that cannot
be met by thinking alone, but which requires differentiated
feeling, the traumatic or pathogenic conflict breaks out. On
the contrary, the critical moment comes to the man who
adapts by feeling when he is faced by a problem requiring
differentiated thought. The afore-mentioned case of the
business man is a clear example of this. The man was an
introvert, who all through his life had left every consideration
of sentiment in the background, that is, in the unconscious.
But when, for the first time in his life, he found himself in a
situation in which nothing could be done except by means of
differentiated feeling, he failed utterly. At the same time,
a very instructive phenomenon occurred; his unconscious
feelings manifested themselves as <em>physical sensations</em> of a
vague nature. This fact harmonises with a generally accepted
experience in our psychology, to wit, that undeveloped feelings
partake of the character of vague physical sensations, since
undifferentiated feelings are as yet identical with subjective
physical sensations. Differentiated feelings are of a more
"abstract" objective nature. This phenomenon may well
be the unconscious basis of the earliest statement of psychological
types that is known to me; namely, the three types
of the Valentinian School. They held the undifferentiated
type to be the so-called hylic (material) man. He was ranked
below the differentiated types, that is, the psychic (soulful)
man, who corresponds to the extroversion type; and
the pneumatic (spiritual) man, who corresponds to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
introversion type. For these gnostics the "pneumatikos"
stood of course the highest. Christianity, with its "psychic"
(spiritual) nature (principle of love), has indeed contested
this privilege of the gnosis. But even this page may be
turned in the course of time: since, if the signs of the age
are not deceptive, we are now in the great final settlement
of the Christian epoch. We know that, evolution not being
uniformly continuous, when one form of creation has been
outlived, the evolutionary tendency harks back to resume
that form which, after having made a beginning, was left
behind in an undeveloped state.</p>

<p>After this brief digression to generalities, let us return to
our case. If a similar disturbance were to take place in an
extrovert, he would have what are called hysterical symptoms,
that is, symptoms that are also of an apparently physical
nature, which, as our theory indicates, would this time represent
the patient's unconscious undifferentiated thought. As
a matter of fact, we find also a widespread region of phantasy
as the basis of hysterical symptoms, of which many have
been described in detail in the literature of the subject. They
are phantasies of a pronounced sexual, that is physical complexion.
But in reality they are undifferentiated thoughts,
which in common with the undifferentiated feelings are to
some extent physical, and therefore appear as what may be
called physical symptoms.</p>

<p>By taking up again here the thread that was dropped
before, we can now clearly see why it is precisely in the
neurosis that those values which are most lacking to the
individual lie hidden. We might also now return to
the case of the young woman, and apply to it the newly-won
insight. She is an extrovert with an hysterical
neurosis. Let us suppose that this patient had been
"analysed," that is, that the treatment having made it
clear to her what kind of unconscious thoughts lay behind
her symptoms, she had regained possession of the psychic
energy which by becoming unconscious had constituted the
strength of the symptoms. The following practical question
now arises: what can be done with the so-called available<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
energy? It would be rational, and in accordance with the
psychological type of the invalid, to extrovert this energy
again, that is to transfer it to an object, as for instance to
philanthropic or some other useful activities. This way
is possible only in exceptional cases&mdash;there are energetic
natures who do not shrink from care and trouble in a
useful cause, there are people who care immensely about
just such occupations&mdash;otherwise it is not feasible. For it
must not be forgotten, that in the case under consideration,
the libido (that is the technical expression for the psychic
energy) has found its object already unconsciously in the
young Italian, or an appropriate real human substitute.
Under these circumstances such a desirable sublimation,
however natural, is out of the question. For the object of
the energy usually affords a better channel than an ethical
activity, however attractive. Unfortunately there are many
people who always speak of a person, not as he is, but as
he would be if their desires for him were realised. But the
physician is necessarily concerned with the actual personality,
which will obdurately remain the same, until its real character
has been recognised on all sides. An analysis must
necessarily be based upon the recognition of naked reality,
not upon any arbitrarily selected phantasies about a person,
however desirable.</p>

<p>The fact is that the so-called available energy unfortunately
cannot be arbitrarily directed as desired. It follows
its own channel, one which it had already found, even before
we had quite released it from its bondage to the unadapted
form. For we now make the discovery that the phantasies
which were formerly occupied with the young Italian, have
been transferred to the physician himself. The physician
has therefore himself become the object of the unconscious
libido. If this is not the case, or if the patient will on no
account acknowledge the fact of transference, or again, if
the physician either does not understand the phenomenon at
all, or does so wrongly, then violent resistances make their
appearance, which aim at completely breaking off relations
with the doctor. At this point patients leave and look for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
another doctor or for people who "understand" them; or if
they hopelessly relinquish this search they go to pieces.</p>

<p>But if the transference to the physician takes place
and is accepted, a natural channel has thereby been found,
which not only replaces the former, but also makes a
discharge of the energic process possible, and provides a
course that is relatively free from conflict. Therefore if the
libido is allowed its natural course, it will of its own accord
find its way into the transference. Where this is not the
case, it is always a question either of arbitrary rebellion
against the laws of Nature, or of some deficiency in the
physician's work.</p>

<p>Into the transference every conceivable infantile phantasy
is first of all projected; these must then be subjected to the
caustic, that is, analytically dissolved. This was formerly
called the <em>dissolution of the transference</em>. Thereby the energy
is freed from this unsuitable form also, and once again
we are confronted by the problem of disposable energy.
We shall find that an object affording the most favourable
channel has been chosen by Nature even before our search
began.</p>


<p class="p3">V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Personal and the Impersonal Unconscious</span></p>

<p>The fourth stage of our newly won insight is now reached.
The analytical dissolution of the infantile transference phantasies
was continued until it became sufficiently clear, even
to the patient, that he was making his physician into father,
mother, uncle, guardian, teacher, friend or any other kind
of surrogate for parental authority conceivable. But, as
experience is constantly proving, further phantasies make
their appearance, representing the physician as saviour or as
some other divine being. Obviously this is in flagrant contradiction
to the sane reasoning of consciousness. Moreover,
it appears that these divine attributes considerably overstep
the bounds of the Christian conception in which we grew
up. They even assume the guise of heathen allurements, and,
for instance, not infrequently assume the form of animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>The transference is in itself nothing but a projection of
unconscious contents on to the analyst. At first it is the so-called
superficial contents that are projected. During this
stage the physician is interesting as a possible lover (somewhat
after the manner of the young Italian in our case).
Later on, he is a representation of the father, and is the
symbol either of kindness or of severity, according to what
the patient formerly imputed to his real father. Occasionally
the doctor even appears to the patient as a kind of mother,
which, though sounding somewhat strange, really lies well
within the bounds of possibility. All these projections of
phantasy have an underlying basis of personal reminiscences.</p>

<p>But presently other forms of phantasy appear, bearing an
extravagantly effusive and impossible character. The physician
now appears to be endowed with uncanny qualities; he
may be either a wizard or a demoniacal criminal, or his
counterpart of virtue, a saviour. Later on he appears as an
incomprehensible mixture of both sides. It should be clearly
understood that the physician does not appear to the patient's
consciousness in these forms, but that phantasies come up to
the surface representing the doctor in this guise. If, as is
not seldom the case, the patient cannot forthwith perceive
that his view of the physician is a projection of his own
unconscious, then he will probably behave rather foolishly.
Difficulties often arise at this stage of analysis, making severe
demands upon the good will and patience of both physician
and patient. In a few exceptional cases, a patient cannot
refrain from disseminating the stupidest tales about the
physician. Such people cannot get it into their head that, as
a matter of fact, their phantasies originate in themselves, and
have nothing or very little to do with the physician's actual
character. The pertinacity of this error arises from the
circumstance that there is no foundation of personal memory
for this particular kind of projection. It is occasionally
possible to prove that similar phantasies, for which neither
parent gave reasonable occasion, had at some time in childhood
been attached to the father or mother.</p>

<p>In one of his shorter books, Freud has shown how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
Leonardo da Vinci was influenced in his later life by the fact
that he had two mothers. The fact of the two mothers (or
the double descent) had indeed a reality in Leonardo's case,
but it plays a part with other artists as well. Benvenuto
Cellini had this phantasy of a double descent. It is unquestionably
a mythological theme; many heroes of legend have
two mothers. The phantasy is not founded upon the actual
fact of the hero's having two mothers, but is a widespread
"primordial image" belonging to the secrets of the universal
history of the human mind. It does not belong to the sphere
of personal reminiscences.</p>

<p>In every individual, in addition to the personal memories,
there are also, in Jacob Burckhardt's excellent phrase, the
great "primordial images," the inherited potentialities of
human imagination. They have always been potentially
latent in the structure of the brain. The fact of this inheritance
also explains the otherwise incredible phenomenon, that
the matter and themes of certain legends are met with all
the world over in identical forms. Further, it explains how
it is that persons who are mentally deranged are able to
produce precisely the same images and associations that are
known to us from the study of old manuscripts. I gave some
examples of this in my book on "The Psychology of the Unconscious."
I do not hereby assert the <em>transmission of representations</em>,
but only of the <em>possibility of such representations</em>,
which is a very different thing.</p>

<p>It is therefore in this further stage of the transference
that those phantasies are produced that have no basis in
personal reminiscence. Here it is a matter of the manifestation
of the deeper layers of the unconscious, where the
primordial universally-human images are lying dormant.</p>

<p>This discovery leads to the fourth stage of the new conception:
that is, to the recognition of a <em>differentiation in the
unconscious itself</em>. We are now obliged to differentiate a
personal unconscious and an impersonal or super-personal
unconscious. We also term the latter the <em>absolute or collective</em>
unconscious, because it is quite detached from what is
personal, and because it is also absolutely universal, wherefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
its contents may be found in every head, which of
course is not the case with the personal contents.</p>

<p>The primordial images are quite the most ancient, universal,
and deep thoughts of mankind. They are feeling just
as much as thought, and might therefore be termed <em>original
thought-feelings</em>.</p>

<p>We have therewith now found the object selected by the
libido when it was freed from the personal-infantile form of
transference. Namely, that it sinks down into the depths of
the unconscious, reviving what has been dormant there from
immemorial ages. It has discovered the buried treasure out
of which mankind from time to time has drawn, raising
thence its gods and demons, and all those finest and most
tremendous thoughts without which man would cease to be
man.</p>

<p>Let us take as an example one of the greatest thoughts
to which the nineteenth century gave birth&mdash;the idea of the
<em>conservation of energy</em>. <cite>Robert Mayer</cite> is the originator of this
idea. He was a physician, not a physicist nor a natural
philosopher, to either of whom the creation of such an idea
would have been more germane. It is of great importance
to realise that in the real sense of the word, Robert Mayer's
idea was not <em>created</em>. Neither was it brought about through
the fusion of the then-existent conceptions and scientific
hypotheses. It grew in the originator, and was conditioned
by him. Robert Mayer wrote (1841) to Griesinger as
follows: "I by no means concocted the theory at the writing-desk."
He goes on to report about certain physiological
investigations that he made in 1840-41 as doctor on board
ship, and continues: "If one wishes to be enlightened about
physiological matters, some knowledge of physical processes
is indispensable, unless one prefers to work from the metaphysical
side, which is immensely distasteful to me. I
therefore kept to physics, clinging to the subject with such
ardour that, although it may well seem ridiculous to say so,
I cared little about what part of the world we were in. I
preferred to remain aboard where I could work uninterruptedly,
and where many an hour gave me such a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
of <em>being inspired</em> in a way I can never remember having
experienced either before or since.</p>

<p>"A few flashes of thought that thrilled through me"&mdash;this
was in the harbour of Surabaja&mdash;"were immediately
diligently pursued, leading again in their turn to new
subjects. Those times are passed, but subsequent quiet
examination <em>of what then emerged</em>, has taught me that it was a
truth which can <em>not only be subjectively felt</em>, but also proved
objectively; whether this could be done by <em>one who has so
little knowledge</em> of physics as I have, is a matter which
obviously, I must leave undecided."</p>

<p>Heim, in his book on Energetics, expresses the opinion:
"that Robert Mayer's new thought did not gradually detach
itself by dint of revolving it in his mind, from the conceptions
of power transmitted from the past, <em>but belongs to
those ideas that are intuitively conceived, which, originating in
other spheres of a mental kind, surprise thought, as it were,
compelling it to transform its inherited notions conformably
with those ideas</em>."</p>

<p>The question now arises, whence did this new idea that
forced itself upon consciousness with such elemental power
spring? And whence did it derive such strength that it
was able to effect consciousness so forcibly that it could
be completely withdrawn from all the manifold impressions
of a first voyage in the tropics? These questions are not
easy to answer. If we apply our theory to this case the
explanation would run as follows: <em>The idea of energy and of
its conservation must be a primordial image that lay dormant in
the absolute unconscious</em>. This conclusion obviously compels
us to prove that a similar primordial image did really exist
in the history of the human mind, and continued to be
effective through thousands of years. As a matter of fact,
evidence of this can be produced without difficulty. <em>Primitive
religions, in the most dissimilar regions of the earth, are
founded upon this image.</em> These are the so-called <em>dynamistic
religions</em>, whose sole and distinctive thought is the
existence of some universal magical power upon which
everything depends. The well-known English scholars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Taylor and Frazer, both wrongly interpreted this idea as
animism. Primitive peoples do not mean souls or spirits
by their conception of power, but in reality something that
the American investigator <em>Lovejoy</em><a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> most aptly terms "primitive
energetics."</p>

<p>In an investigation appertaining to this subject, I showed
that this notion comprises the idea of soul, spirit, God, health,
physical strength, fertility, magic power, influence, might,
prestige, curative remedies, as well as certain states of mind
which are characterised by the setting loose of affects.
Among certain Polynesians "Melungu" (that is this primitive
concept of energy) is spirit, soul, demoniacal being, magic,
prestige. If anything astonishing happens, the people cry
"Melungu." This notion of power is also the first rendering
of the concept of God among primitive peoples. The
image has undergone many variations in the course of
history. In the Old Testament this magic power is seen in
the burning bush, and shines in the face of Moses. It is
manifest in the Gospels as the outpouring of the Holy Spirit,
as cloven tongues of fire from heaven. In Heraclitus it
appears as universal energy, as "eternally living fire";
for the Persians it is the fiery brightness, haôma, divine
mercy; for the Stoics it is heimarmene, the power of
destiny. In mediæval legend it is seen as the aura, or the
halo of the saint. It blazes forth in great flames from the
hut where the saint is lying in ecstasy. The saints reflect
the sum of this power, the storehouse of light, in their faces.
According to ancient concepts this power is the soul itself;
the idea of its immortality contains that of its <em>conservation</em>.
The Buddhistic and primitive conception of the metempsychosis
(transmigration of souls) contains the idea of its
<em>unlimited capacity for transformation under constant conservation</em>.</p>

<p>This thought has obviously therefore been imprinted on
the human brain for untold ages. That is why it lies ready
in the unconscious of every one. Only certain conditions
are needed in order to let it appear again. These conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
were obviously fulfilled in the example of Robert Mayer.
The greatest and best thoughts form themselves upon these
primordial images, which are the ancient common property
of humanity.</p>

<p>After this instance of the nascence of new ideas out of
the treasury of primordial images, we will resume the further
delineation of the process of transference. It was seen that
the libido of the patient seizes upon its new object in those
apparently preposterous and peculiar phantasies, namely
the contents of the absolute unconscious. As I already observed,
the unacknowledged projection of primordial images
upon the physician constitutes a danger for further treatment
which should not be undervalued. The images contain
not only every beautiful and great thought and feeling of
humanity, but also every deed of shame and devilry of which
human beings have ever been capable. Now, if the patient
cannot differentiate the physician's personality from these
projections, there is an end to mutual understanding, and
human relations become impossible. If however the patient
avoids this Charybdis, he falls into the Scylla of <em>introjecting</em>
these images, that is, he does not ascribe their qualities to
the physician but to himself. This peril is just as great.
If he projects, he vacillates between an extravagant and
morbid deification, and a spiteful contempt of his physician.
In the case of introjection, he falls into a ludicrous self-deification
or moral self-laceration. The mistake that he
makes in both cases consists in attributing the contents of
the absolute unconscious to himself personally. Thus he
makes himself into both God and devil. This is the psychological
reason why human beings have always needed demons,
and could not live without gods. There is the exception, of
course, of a few specially clever specimens of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">homo occidentalis</i>
of yesterday and the day before&mdash;supermen whose
God is dead, wherefore they themselves become gods. There
is also the example of Nietzsche, who confessedly required
chloral in order to be able to exist. These supermen even
become rationalistic petty gods, with thick skulls and cold
hearts. The concept of God is simply a necessary psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
function of an irrational nature that has altogether
no connection with the question of God's existence. This
latter question is one of the most fatuous that can be put.
It is indeed sufficiently evident that man cannot conceive
a God, much less realise that he actually exists, so little is
he able to imagine a process that is not causally conditioned.
Theoretically, of course, no accidentality can exist, that is
certain, once and for all. On the other hand, in practical
life, we are continually stumbling upon accidental happenings.
It is similar with the existence of God; it is once and
for all an absurd problem. But the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">consensus gentium</i> has
spoken of gods for æons past, and will be speaking of them
in æons to come. Beautiful and perfect as man may think
his reason, he may nevertheless assure himself that it is
only one of the possible mental functions, coinciding merely
with the corresponding side of the phenomena of the universe.
All around is the irrational, that which is not congruous with
reason. And this irrationalism is likewise a psychological
function, namely the absolute unconscious; whilst the
function of consciousness is essentially rational. Consciousness
must have rational relations, first of all in order to
discover some order in the chaos of disordered individual
phenomena in the universe; and secondly, in order to labour
at whatever lies within the area of human possibility. We
are laudably and usefully endeavouring to exterminate so
far as is practicable the chaos of what is irrational, both in
and around us. Apparently we are making considerable
progress with this process. A mental patient once said to
me, "Last night, doctor, I disinfected the whole heavens
with sublimate, and yet did not discover any God." Something
of the kind has happened to us. Heraclitus, the
ancient, that really very wise man, discovered the most
wonderful of all psychological laws, namely, the <em>regulating
function of antithesis</em>. He termed this "enantiodromia"
(clashing together), by which he meant that at some time
everything meets with its opposite. (Here I beg to remind
the reader of the case of the American business man, which
shows the enantiodromia most distinctly.) The rational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
attitude of civilisation necessarily terminates in its antithesis,
namely in the irrational devastation of civilisation. Man
may not <em>identify</em> himself with reason, for he is not wholly a
rational being, and never can or ever will become one. That
is a fact of which every pedant of civilisation should take note.
What is irrational cannot and may not be stamped out. The
gods cannot and may not die. Woe betide those men who have
disinfected heaven with rationalism; God-Almightiness has
entered into them, because they would not admit God as an
absolute function. They are identified with their unconscious,
and are therefore its sport. (For where God is nearest, there
the danger is greatest.) Is the present war supposed to be a
war of economics? That is a neutral American "business-like"
standpoint, that does not take the blood, tears, unprecedented
deeds of infamy and great distress into account,
and which completely ignores the fact that this war is really
an <em>epidemic of madness</em>. The several parties project their
unconscious upon each other, hence the mad confusion of
ideas in every head. This is the enantiodromia that occurs
in the individual life of man, as well as in that of peoples.
The legend of the Tower of Babel turns out to be a tenable
truth.</p>

<p>Only he escapes from the cruel law of enantiodromia who
knows how to separate himself from the unconscious&mdash;not by
repressing it, for then it seizes him from behind&mdash;<em>but by presenting
it visibly to himself as something that is totally different
from him</em>.</p>

<p>This gives the solution of the Scylla and Charybdis
problem which I described above. The patient must learn
to differentiate in his thoughts between what is the ego and
what is the non-ego. The latter is the collective psyche or
absolute unconscious. By this means he will acquire the
material with which henceforward, for a long time, he will
have to come to terms. Thereby the energy, that before was
invested in unsuitable pathological forms, will have found its
appropriate sphere. In order to differentiate the psychological
ego from the psychological non-ego, man must necessarily
stand <em>upon firm feet</em> in his ego-function; that is, <em>he must fulfil</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
<em>his duty towards life completely, so that he may in every respect
be a vitally living member of human society</em>. Anything that he
neglects in this respect descends into the unconscious and
reinforces its position, so that he is in danger of being
swallowed up by it, if his ego-function is not established.
Severe penalties are attached to that. As indicated by old
Synesius, the "spiritualised soul (pneumatike psyché) becomes
god and demon, a state in which it suffers the divine
penalties," that is, it suffers being torn asunder by the
Zagreus, an experience which Nietzsche also underwent at
the beginning of his insanity, where, in "Ecce Homo," the
God whom he was despairingly resisting in front assailed
him from behind. Enantiodromia is the being torn asunder
into the pairs of opposites, which opposites are only proper
to "the god," and therefore also to the deified man, who owes
likeness to God to his having prevailed over his gods.</p>


<p>VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Synthetic or Constructive Method</span></p>

<p>We now reach the fifth stage of progressive understanding.
The coming to terms with the unconscious is a technical
performance to which the name of <em>transcendental function</em> has
been given because a new function is produced, which being
based upon both real and imaginary, or rational and irrational
data, makes a bridge between the rational and irrational
functions of the psyche. The basis of the transcendental
function is a <em>new method of treating psychological materials</em>
such as dreams and phantasies. The theories previously
discussed were based upon an exclusively causal-reductive
procedure, which reduces the dream or phantasy to its component
reminiscences, and the instinctive processes that
underlie them. I have already stated the justification as
well as the limitations of this proceeding. It reaches the
end of its usefulness at the moment when the dream symbols
no longer permit of a reduction to personal reminiscences or
aspirations; that is when the images of the absolute unconscious
begin to be produced. It would be quite inappropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
to reduce these collective ideas to what is personal, and not
only inappropriate but even actually pernicious, a fact that
has been impressed upon me by disagreeable experiences.
The values of the images or symbols of the absolute unconscious
are only disclosed if they are subjected to a synthetic
(not analytical) treatment. Just as analysis (the causally
reductive procedure) disintegrates the symbol into its components,
so the synthetic procedure synthesises the symbol into
a universal and comprehensible expression. The synthetic
procedure is by no means easy; I will therefore give an
example, by means of which I can explain the whole process.</p>

<p>A patient had the following dream. She was just at the
critical juncture between the analysis of the personal unconscious
and the commencement of the production of the absolute
unconscious. "<em>I am on the point of crossing a broad
and rapid stream. There is no bridge, but I find a ford where
I can cross. As I am just on the point of doing so, a big crab
that lay hidden in the water seizes my foot and does not let it go.</em>"
She awoke in fear. Associations with the dream were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <em>Stream.</em>&mdash;It forms a boundary that is difficult to cross.
I must surmount an obstacle; I suppose it refers to the fact
that I am getting on very slowly; I suppose I ought to reach
the other side.</p>

<p>2. <em>Ford.</em>&mdash;An opportunity for getting safely across, a
possible way; otherwise the stream would be too difficult.
The possibility of surmounting the obstacle lies in the analytical
treatment.</p>

<p>3. <em>Crab.</em>&mdash;The crab lay quite hidden in the water; I did
not see it at first. Cancer is a fearful incurable illness. (A
series of recollections of Mrs. X., who died of cancer, followed.)
I am afraid of this illness. A crab<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> is an animal that walks
backwards; obviously it wants to pull me down into the
stream. It clutched me in a gruesome way, and I was awfully
afraid. What prevents my getting across? Oh yes, I had
another great scene with my friend.</p>

<p>It must be explained that there is something special about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
this friendship. We have here an ardent attachment, bordering
on the homosexual. It has been going on for years.
The friend is in many respects like the patient, and is also
nervous. They have pronounced artistic interests in common.
But the patient is the stronger personality of the two. They
are both nervous, and their mutual relation being too engrossing,
cuts them off too much from other possibilities of
life. In spite of an "ideal friendship" they have at times
tremendous scenes, owing to their mutual irritability. Evidently
the unconscious wishes to put some distance between
them, but they refuse to pay attention to it. A "scene"
usually begins by one of them finding that she does not yet
understand the other well enough, and that they ought to talk
more openly together; whereupon both make enthusiastic
endeavours to talk things out. Misunderstandings supervene
almost directly, provoking fresh scenes, each worse than the
last. The quarrel was in its way and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faute de mieux</i> a pleasure
to both of them, which they were unwilling to relinquish. My
patient, especially, was unable for a very long time to renounce
the sweet pain of not being understood by her best
friend, although, as she said, every scene "tired her to
death." She had long since realised that this friendship had
become superfluous, and that it was only from mistaken
ambition that she clung to the belief that she could yet make
something ideal out of it. The patient had formerly had an
extravagant, fantastic relation to her mother, and after her
mother's death had transferred her feelings to her friend.</p>


<p class="p3">VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Analytical (Causal-reductive) Interpretation.</span><a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>This interpretation may be summed up in a sentence: "I
understand that I ought to get to the other side of the stream
(that is, give up the relation with the friend), but I would
much rather that my friend did not let me out of her claws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
(embrace)." That is, expressed as an <em>infantile wish</em>: Mother
would like to attract me to herself again by the well-known
mode of enthusiastic embraces. The incompatibility of the
wish lies in the strong under-current of <em>homosexuality</em>, the existence
of which had been abundantly proved by obvious facts.
The crab seizes her foot. The patient having big, "manly"
feet, she plays a masculine part towards her friend, having
also corresponding sexual fantasies. The foot is known to
have phallic significance. (Detailed evidence of this is to be
found in <em>Aigremont's</em> writings.) The complete interpretation
would run as follows: The reason why she will not let her
friend go is because her unconscious homosexual wishes are
set upon her. As these wishes are morally and æsthetically
incompatible with the tendency of the conscious personality,
they are repressed, and therefore unconscious. The fear is
an expression of this repressed wish.</p>

<p>This interpretation is exceedingly depreciative of the
patient's high-pitched conscious ideal of friendship. It is true
at this point in analysis she would no longer have taken this
interpretation amiss. Some time before certain facts had
sufficiently convinced her of her homosexual tendency, so
that she was able to acknowledge the existence of this inclination
frankly, although it was of course painful for her to do so.
Therefore if, at this stage of the treatment, I had informed
her that this was the interpretation, I should not have
encountered resistances from her. She had already overcome
the painfulness of this unwelcome tendency by understanding
it. But she would have said to me: "Why do we
analyse this dream at all? It is only repeating what I have
now known for a long while." It is true this interpretation
does not reveal anything new to the patient, and it is therefore
uninteresting and ineffective. This kind of interpretation
would at the beginning of the treatment have been impossible
in this case, because the patient's prudishness would under no
circumstances have acknowledged it. The "venom" of understanding
had to be instilled very carefully, and in the smallest
of doses, until the patient gradually became more enlightened.
But when the analytical or causal-reductive interpretation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
instead of furnishing something new, persistently brings the
same material in different variations, then the moment has
come when another mode of interpretation is called for. The
causal-reductive procedure has certain drawbacks. First, it
does not take strictly into account the patient's associations&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
in this case the association of the illness ("cancer") with
"crab" (Krebs = cancer). Second, the particular choice of
symbol remains obscure. For instance, why does the friend-mother
appear as a crab? A prettier and more plastic representation
would have been a nymph. ("Half dragged she
him, half sank he down,"<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> etc.) An octopus, a dragon, a
serpent, or a fish could have performed the same services.
Third, the causal-reductive procedure completely ignores that
a dream is a subjective phenomenon, and that consequently
even an exhaustive interpretation can never connect the crab
with the mother or the friend, but only with the dreamer's
idea of them. The whole dream is the dreamer; she is the
stream, the crossing, and the crab. That is to say these
details are expressions of psychological conditions and tendencies
in the subject's unconscious.</p>

<p>I have therefore introduced the following terminology.
I call interpretations in which the dream symbols are treated
as representations of the real objects <em>interpretation upon the
objective plane</em>. The opposite interpretation is that which
connects every fragment of the dream (<i>e.g.</i> all the persons
who do anything) with the dreamer himself. This is <em>interpretation
upon the subjective plane</em>. Objective interpretation is
<em>analytical</em>, because it dissects the dream contents into complexes
of reminiscence, and finds their relation to real conditions.
Subjective interpretation is <em>synthetic</em>, because it
detaches the fundamental underlying complexes of reminiscence
from their actual causes, regarding them as tendencies
or parts of the subject, and reintegrating them with the
subject. (In experiencing something I do not merely experience
the object, but in the first place myself, although this
is only the case if I render myself account of the experience.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>The synthetic or constructive procedure of interpretation<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
is therefore based upon the version on the subjective plane.</p>


<p class="p3">VIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Synthetic (Constructive) Interpretation.</span></p>

<p>The patient is unconscious of the fact that it is in herself
that the obstacle lies which should be overcome, the boundary
that is difficult to cross which impedes further progress.
But it is possible to cross the boundary. It is true that just
here a peculiar and unexpected peril threatens, namely, something
"animal" (non-human or super-human) which moves
backwards and goes into the depths of the stream, wanting to
draw down the dreamer as a whole personality. This danger
is, moreover, like the deadly disease of cancer, which begins
secretly somewhere, and is incurable (overpowering). The
patient imagines that her friend hinders her, pulling her
down. So long as this is her belief she must perforce influence
her friend, "draw her up," teach, improve, educate
her, and make futile and impractically idealistic efforts in
order to avoid being dragged down herself. Of course, the
friend makes similar endeavours, being in a like case with the
patient. So both of them keep jumping upon each other like
fighting cocks, each trying to fly over the other's head. The
higher the point to which the one screws herself, the higher
must the other also try to get. Why? Because each thinks
the fault lies in the other, in the object. Interpretation of the
dream on the subjective plane brings deliverance from this
absurdity, for it shows the patient that she has something in
herself that is hindering her from crossing the boundary;
that is, from getting out of the one position or attitude into
another. To interpret change of place as change of attitude
is supported by the mode of expression in certain primitive
languages, where, <i>e.g.</i>, the phrase "I am on the point of going,"
is "I am at the place of going." In order to understand the
language of dreams, we need plenty of parallels from the
psychology of primitive peoples, as well as from historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
symbolism. This is so because dreams originate in the
unconscious, which contains the residual potentialities of
function of all preceding epochs of the history of the
evolution of man.</p>

<p>Obviously, in our interpretation everything now depends
upon understanding what is meant by the crab. We know
that it symbolizes something that comes to light in the friend
(she connects the crab with the friend), and also something
that came to light in the mother. Whether both mother and
friend really have this quality in them is irrelevant as regards
the patient. The situation will only be changed when the
patient herself has changed. Nothing can be changed in the
mother because she is dead. The friend cannot be urged to
alter; if she wants to alter herself, that is her own affair.
The fact that the quality in question is associated with the
mother indicates that it is something infantile. What is there
in common in the patient's relation both to her mother and
her friend? What is common to both is a violently extravagant
demand for love, the patient feeling herself overwhelmed
by its passion. This claim is an overpowering infantile
craving which is characteristically blind. What is in
question here is a part of her libido that has not been educated,
differentiated, nor humanized, retaining still the compulsive
character of an instinct, because it has not yet been tamed by
domestication. An <em>animal</em> is a perfectly appropriate symbol for
this rôle of libido. But why is the animal a crab in this particular
instance? The patient associates cancer with it, of which
disease Mrs. X. died at the age the patient has just reached.
It may, therefore, well be that this is an allusion to an identification
with Mrs. X. We must therefore make inquiries about
this Mrs. X. The patient relates the following facts about
her: Mrs. X. was widowed early; she was very cheerful and
enjoyed life. She had a number of adventures with men,
especially with one particular man, a gifted artist, who the
patient herself knew personally and who always impressed her
as very fascinating and weird.</p>

<p>An identification can only result from an unrecognized
unconscious resemblance. Now what is the resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
between our patient and Mrs. X.? I was able here to remind
the patient of a series of former fantasies and dreams, which
had shown plainly that she also had a frivolous vein in her,
although anxiously repressing it, because she vaguely feared
it might seduce her to an immoral life. We have now gained
a further essential contribution for a right understanding of
the "animal" rôle, which evidently represents an untamed,
instinctive greed, which in this case is directed to men. At
the same time we understand a further reason why she cannot
let go of her friend. She must cling to her in order not to
fall a prey to this other tendency, which seems so much
more dangerous. By these means she remains at an infantile
homosexual stage, which serves her as a defence. (Experience
proves this erection of defences to be one of the most effective
motives for the retention of unadapted, infantile relations.)
But in this missing libido in the animal rôle lies her well-being,
the germ of her future healthy personality, which does
not shrink from the hazards of human life.</p>

<p>But the patient had drawn another conclusion from the
fate of Mrs. X., having conceived her severe illness and early
death as a punishment of fate for her gay life which the patient,
although certainly not confessing to this feeling, always envied
her. When Mrs. X. died, the patient pulled a long face,
beneath which a "human, all too human," malicious satisfaction
was hidden. As a punishment for this tendency the
patient, taking Mrs. X.'s example as a warning, deterred herself
from living and from further development, and burdened
herself with the misery of this unsatisfying friendship. Of
course this concatenation had not been consciously clear to
her, otherwise she would never have acted as she had done.
The truth of this conclusion can be proved by the material.</p>

<p>The history of this identification by no means ends here.
The patient subsequently emphasized the fact that Mrs. X.
had a not inconsiderable artistic capacity which developed
only after her husband's death and which led to her friendship
with the artist. This fact seems to be one of the essential
incentives to the identification, if we call to mind that the
patient had already told us what a striking impression she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
received from the artist. A fascination of this kind is never exclusively
exercised by one person only upon the other. It is a
phenomenon of reciprocal relation between two persons in so far
as the fascinated person must provide a suitable predisposition.
But she must be unconscious of this predisposition, otherwise
there will be no fascination. Fascination is a phenomenon of
compulsion which lacks conscious ground; that is, it is not
a process of the will, but a phenomenon coming to the surface
from the unconscious, and forcing itself compulsorily upon
consciousness. All compulsions arise from unconscious motives.
It must therefore be assumed that the patient possesses a
similar unconscious predisposition to that of the artist. She
becomes identified with this artist, and is also identified with
him <em>as man</em>. Here we are at once reminded of the analysis
of the dream, where we met an allusion to the "masculine"
foot. As a matter of fact, the patient plays a thoroughly
masculine part towards her friend, being the active one who
continually takes the lead, commanding her friend and occasionally
even forcing her somewhat violently to some course
that only the patient desires. Her friend is distinctly feminine
both in her external appearance and otherwise, whilst the
patient is also externally of a somewhat masculine type. Her
voice is stronger and deeper than that of her friend. She now
describes Mrs. X. as a very feminine woman, her gentleness
and amiability being comparable to that of her friend, so she
thinks. This gives us a new clue. The patient is obviously
playing towards her friend the artist's part towards Mrs. X.
Thus she unconsciously completes her identification with
Mrs. X. and her lover. In this way she is giving expression to
her frivolous vein which she had repressed so carefully. She
is not living it consciously, however, but is herself played upon
by her own unconscious tendency.</p>

<p>We now know a great deal about the crab: it represents
the inner psychology of this untamed part of the libido. The
unconscious identifications always keep drawing her on. They
have this power because being unconscious they cannot be
subjected to insight and correction. The crab is the symbol
of the unconscious contents. These contents are always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
seducing the patient to retain her relation to the friend. (The
"crab goes backwards.") But the relation to the friend is
synonymous with illness, she became nervous through it
(hence the association of illness).</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, this really belongs to the analysis on the
objective plane. But we must not forget that we only arrive
at understanding by applying the <em>subjective</em> interpretation,
which thereby proves itself to be an important heuristic
principle. For practical purposes we might rest quite satisfied
with the result we have already reached. But we seek here
to satisfy all the requirements of the theory. Not all the
associations have yet been used; neither is the significance of
the choice of symbols yet demonstrated sufficiently.</p>

<p>We will now recur to the patient's remark that the crab
lay hidden under the water in the stream, and that she had
not seen it at first. She had not at first perceived the unconscious
relations that have just been elucidated; they lay hidden
in the water. But the stream is the obstacle preventing her
from going across. It is precisely the unconscious relations
binding her to her friend that have been hindering her.
The unconscious was the obstacle. In this case, therefore, the
water signifies the unconscious, or, it were better to say, the
<em>being unconscious</em> the being hidden, for the crab is also something
unconscious, namely, the portion of the libido that was
hidden in the unconscious.</p>


<p class="p3">IX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Dominants of the Super-Personal Unconscious.</span></p>

<p>The task now lies before us of raising the unconscious data
and their relations that have been hitherto understood upon
the objective plane, to the <em>subjective</em> plane. To this end we
must once more separate them from their objects, conceiving
them as images, related in a subjective way to function-complexes
in the patient's own unconscious. Raised to
the subjective plane, Mrs. X. is the person who showed the
patient the way to do something that the patient herself feared
while unconsciously desiring it. Mrs. X. therefore represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
that which the patient would like to become, and yet does not
quite want to. In a certain sense Mrs. X. is a picture of the
patient's future character. The fascinating artist cannot be
raised to the subjective plane, because the unconscious artistic
gift lying dormant in the patient has already been covered
over by Mrs. X. It would be quite right to say that the artist
is the image of the masculine element in the patient, which
not being consciously realised, is still lying in the unconscious.
In a certain sense this is indeed true, the patient actually
deluding herself as regards this matter. That is, she seems
to herself to be particularly tender, sensitive and feminine,
with nothing in the least masculine about her. She was indignantly
amazed when I drew her attention to her masculine
traits. But the reason why she is fascinated by something
mysterious in the artist cannot be attributed to what is
masculine in her. That seems to be completely unknown to
her. And yet it must be hiding somewhere, for she has produced
this feeling out of herself.</p>

<p>Whenever a part of libido similar to this cannot be found,
experience teaches us that it has always been <em>projected</em>. But
into whom? Is it still attached to the artist? He has long
ago disappeared from her horizon, and can hardly have taken
the projection with him, because it was firmly fixed in the
patient's unconscious. A similar projection is always actually
present, that is, there must somewhere be some one upon whom
this amount of libido is actually projected, otherwise she would
have felt it consciously.</p>

<p>Thus we once more reach the objective plane, for we cannot
discover this missing projection in any other way. The patient
does not know any man except myself who means anything at
all to her, and as her doctor I mean a good deal to her. Therefore
she has probably projected this part upon me. It is true
I had never noticed anything of the kind. But the exquisitely
deceptive rôles are never presented to the analyst on the
surface, coming to light always only outside the hour of treatment.
I therefore carefully inquire: "Tell me what do I
seem like to you when you are not with me? Am I just the
same then?" Reply: "When I am with you, you are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
pleasant and kind; but when I am alone, or have not seen you
for rather a long time, then the picture I have in my mind of
you changes in an extraordinary way. Sometimes you seem
quite idealized, and then again different." She hesitates; I
help by saying: "Yes, what am I like then?" Reply: "Sometimes
quite dangerous, sinister like an evil magician or demon.
I do not know how I get hold of such ideas. You are not really
a bit like that."</p>

<p>So this part was attached to me as part of a transference;
that is why it was lacking in her inventory. Therewith we
recognize a further important thing. I was confused with
(identified with) the artist, and in her unconscious fantasy she
is Mrs. X. I was easily able to prove this fact by means of
material that had previously been brought to light (sexual
fantasies). But I myself then am the obstacle, the crab, that
is hindering her from getting across. The state of affairs
would be critical if at this particular point we were to limit
ourselves to the objective plane of interpretation. What would
be the use of my explaining: "But I am not this artist at all,
I am not in the least weird as he is, nor am I like an evil
magician." That would leave the patient quite unconvinced
because she would know as well I do that the projection would
continue to exist all the same, and that it is really I who am
hindering her further progress. It is at this point that many
a treatment has come to a standstill. For there is no other
way for the patient here of escaping from the embrace of the
unconscious, but for the physician to raise himself to the subjective
plane, where he is to be regarded as an image. But
an image of what? This is where the greatest difficulty lies.
The doctor will say: "An image of something in the patient's
unconscious." But the patient may object: "What, am I to
suppose myself to be a man, a mysteriously fascinating one to
boot, a wicked wizard and a demon? No, I cannot accept that;
it is nonsense. I'd sooner believe that you are all that." She
is really, so to speak, quite right. It is too preposterous to
want to transfer such things to herself. She cannot permit
herself to be made into a demon, any more than can the
physician. Her eyes flash, a wicked expression appears upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
her face, a glimmer of an unknown hate never seen before,
something snake-like seeming to creep into her. I am
suddenly faced by the possibility of a fatal misunderstanding
with her. What is it? Is it disappointed love? Is she
offended? Does she feel depreciated? There seems to lurk
something of the beast of prey, something really demoniac
in her glance. Is she then after all a demon? Or am I
myself the beast of prey, the demon, and is this a terrified
victim sitting before me, who is trying to defend herself with
the brute force of despair against my wicked spells? But
either idea must be nonsense, phantastical delusion. What
have I come in contact with? What new string is vibrating?
But it is only for a passing moment. The expression upon
the patient's face becoming quiet again, she says, as if relieved:
"It is extraordinary. I feel as if you had touched the
point which I could never get over in relation to my friend.
It is a horrible feeling, something non-human, wicked, and
cruel. I cannot describe how queer this feeling is. At such
moments it makes me hate and despise my friend, although I
struggle against it with all my might and main."</p>

<p>An explanatory light is thrown upon what has happened
by this observation. I have now taken the friend's place.
The friendship has been overcome, the ice of repression is
broken. The patient has without knowing it entered upon
a new phase of her existence. I know that now upon me will
fall everything painful and bad in the relation to the friend.
So also will whatever was good in it, although in violent conflict
with the mysterious unknown quantity X, about which
the patient could never get clear. A new phase, therefore, of
the transference supervenes, which, however, does not as yet
make clearly apparent what the X that is projected upon me
consists of.</p>

<p>It is quite certain, that the most troublesome misunderstandings
threaten if the patient should stick at this stage of
the transference. In that case she will necessarily treat me as
she treated her friend; that is the X will continually be somewhere
in the air giving rise to misunderstandings. The end
would probably be that she would see the evil demon in me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
because she is quite unable to accept the fact that she is herself
the demon. All insoluble conflicts are brought about in
this way. And an insoluble conflict signifies a standstill in
life.</p>

<p>Another possibility is, that the patient should disregard
the obscure point by applying her old preventative against
this new difficulty. That is, she would repress it again,
instead of keeping it conscious, which is the necessary and
obvious demand of the whole method. Nothing is gained by
such repression; on the contrary, the X threatens more from
the unconscious where it is considerably more unpleasant.</p>

<p>Whenever such an unacceptable image emerges, one must
decide whether at bottom it is destined to represent a human
quality or not. "Magician" and "demon" may represent
qualities that are described in this particular fashion, in order
that they may speedily be recognized as <em>not human but mythological
qualities</em>. Magician and demon being mythological
figures aptly express the unknown "non-human" feelings
which had surprised the patient. These attributes are not
applicable to a human personality; being as a rule judgments
of character <em>intuitively</em> and not critically approved, which are
projected upon our fellow-beings, inevitably doing serious
injury to human relations.</p>

<p><em>Such attributes always indicate that contents of the super-personal
or absolute unconscious are being projected.</em> Neither
demons nor wicked magicians are reminiscences of personal
experiences, although every one has, of course, at some time or
other heard or read of them. Although one has heard of a rattle-snake,
it would hardly be appropriate to describe a lizard or a
blind-worm as a rattle-snake, simply because one was startled
by their rustling. Similarly, one would hardly term a fellow-being
a demon, unless some kind of demoniacal influence were
closely associated with him. If, however, the demoniacal influence
were really part of his personal character, it would show
itself everywhere, and then this human being would be a
demon, a kind of werwolf. But such an ascription is mythology;
in other words, it is from the collective and not from
the individual psyche. Inasmuch as through our unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
we have a share in the historical collective psyche, we naturally
dwell unconsciously in a world of werwolves, demons, magicians,
etc., these being things which have always affected man
most profoundly. We have just as much a part in gods and
devils, saviours and criminals. But it would be absurd to
want to ascribe to one's personal self the possibilities that
are potentially existing in the human unconscious. It is,
therefore, essential to make as clear a distinction as possible
between the personal and the impersonal assets of our psyche.
This is by no means intended to nullify the occasional great
effects due to the existence of the contents of the absolute
unconscious; but these contents of the collective psyche should
be differentiated from those belonging to the individual psyche.
For simple-minded people, of course, these things were never
separated, the projection of gods, demons, etc., not having been
understood as a psychological function were simply accounted
concretistical realities. Their projectional character was never
perceived. It was only with the advent of the epoch of
scepticism that it was realized that the gods did not really exist
except as projections. With that the matter was set at rest.
But the psychological function corresponding to it was by no
means set at rest, for it lapsed into the unconscious and began
to poison men with a surplus of libido that had hitherto been
invested in the cult of idols or gods. Obviously, the depreciation
and repression of such a powerful function as that of
religion has serious consequences for the psychology of the
individual. The reflux of this libido strengthens the unconscious
prodigiously, so that it begins to exercise a powerful
compulsory influence upon consciousness and its archaic
collective contents. One period of scepticism came to a close
with the horrors of the French Revolution. At the present
time we are again experiencing an ebullition of the unconscious
destructive powers of the collective psyche. The result
is an unparalleled general slaughter. That is just what the
unconscious was tending towards. This tendency had previously
been inordinately strengthened by the rationalism of
modern life, which by depreciating everything irrational,
caused the function of irrationalism to sink into the unconscious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
But the function once in the unconscious will from thence
work unceasing havoc, like an incurable disease whose
centre cannot be eradicated. For then the individual and the
nation alike are compelled to live irrationally, and even to
apply their highest idealism and their best wit to make this
madness of irrationalism as complete as possible. We see
examples of this on a small scale in our patient. She turned
from a possibility of life that seemed to her irrational (Mrs. X.)
in order to live it in a pathological form, to her own loss, and
with an unsuitable object.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, no possible alternative but to acknowledge
irrationalism as a psychological function that is necessary
and always existent. Its results are not to be taken as concrete
realities (that would involve repression), but as <em>psychological
realities</em>. They are realities because they are <em>effective</em>
things, that is, they are <em>actualities</em>.</p>

<p>The collective unconscious is the sediment of all the experience
of the universe of all time, and is also an image
of the universe that has been in process of formation for
untold ages. In the course of time certain features have
become prominent in this image, the so-called <em>dominants</em>.
These dominants are the ruling powers, the gods; that is, the
representations resulting from dominating laws and principles,
from average regularities in the issue of the images that the
brain has received as a consequence of secular processes.</p>

<p>In so far as the images formed in the brain are relatively
faithful portrayals of psychic happenings they will correspond
to their dominants; that is, their general characteristic
features, made prominent by the accumulation of similar
experiences, will correspond to certain physical fundamental
facts that are also universal. Hence it is possible to transfer
unconscious images to physical events direct as intuitive
ideas; <i>e.g.</i> <em>ether</em> the primeval breath or soul-substance
appears in man's conceptions the whole world over; so, too,
<em>energy</em>, the magic force, which is equally widespread.</p>

<p>On account of their connection with physical things the
dominants usually make their appearance as projections, appearing,
indeed&mdash;if the projections are unconscious&mdash;in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
persons of the immediate environment, as a rule in the form
of abnormal under- or over-valuations, which excite misunderstandings,
conflict, infatuations, and various kinds of folly.
People say: "He makes a god of So-and-so," or "So-and-so
is X.'s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bête noire</i>." They also give rise to the formation of
modern myths, that is, fantastic rumours, suspicions and
prejudices.</p>

<p>The dominants of the collective unconscious are therefore
extremely important things of significant effect, to which
great attention should be paid. They must not be repressed,
but must be given most careful consideration. They usually
appear as projections, and since projections are only attached
where there is some external stimulus, it is very difficult to
appraise them aright, on account of the relation of the unconscious
images with the object. If some one projects the
dominant of "devil" into a fellow-being, this occurs because
this other person has something in him that makes the
attachment of the devil dominant possible. But that is by
no means to say that this person is therefore, so to speak,
a devil; on the contrary, he may be a particularly good
fellow, but being antipathetic to the one who projects, a
"devilish effect" is brought about between the two. This
does not mean that the one who projects is a devil, although
he must recognize that he too, just as much, has something
devilish in him, and has been gulled by it, inasmuch as he
projected it; but that does not make him a devil; indeed, he
may be just as decent a man as the other. In such a case
the appearance of the devil dominant means: the two persons
are incompatible (for the moment and for the near future),
wherefore the unconscious splits them asunder and holds
them apart from each other.</p>

<p>One of the dominants that is almost always met in the
analysis of projections of collective unconscious contents is
the "magical demon;" it is of preponderating sinister effect.
"The Golem," by <cite>Meyrink</cite>, is a good example of this; also the
Thibetan wizard in Meyrink's "Fledermäusen," who lets the
world-war loose by magic. Obviously Meyrink formed this
image independently and freely out of his unconscious, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
giving word and picture to a feeling similar to the one that my
patient had projected upon me. The dominant of magic also
appears in "Zarathustra," whilst in "Faust" it is, so to say,
the hero himself.</p>

<p>The picture of this demon is the lowest and most elementary
concept of God. It is the dominant of the primitive
tribal magic-man, or a singularly gifted personality endowed
with magic power. This figure very frequently makes an
appearance in my patient's unconscious as a <em>dark-skinned
being of Mongolian type</em>.</p>

<p>An important step forward has been taken by the recognition
of the dominants of the absolute unconscious. The
magical or demoniac effect of the fellow-being is made to
disappear by the feeling being realised as a definite projection
of the absolute unconscious. On the other hand, a completely
new and unsuspected task now lies before us: namely,
the question in what way the ego should come to terms with
this psychological non-ego. Should one rest satisfied with
having verified the effective existence of unconscious dominants,
leaving the matter to take care of itself?</p>

<p>To leave it at this point would be the means of creating
a permanent state of dissociation in the subject, a conflict
between the individual psyche and the collective psyche.
Upon the one side we should have the differentiated modern
ego, whilst upon the other a kind of uncivilized negro representative
of a thoroughly primitive state. That would mean that
we should have what really does exist, a crust of civilization
over a dark-skinned brute; the cleavage would be distinct
and demonstrable before our very eyes. But such a dissociation
requires immediate synthesis and cultivation of what is
undeveloped. There must be a union of these two aspects.</p>

<p>Before entering upon this new question let us first return
to the dream from which we started. The discussion has
given us a broader understanding of the dream, and especially
of an essential part of it, namely, the fear. This fear is a
demoniac fear of the dominants of the collective unconscious.
We saw that the patient identifies herself with Mrs. X.,
expressing thereby that she also has some relation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
mysterious artist. It was apparent also that she identified
the physician (myself) with the artist; and further that when
taken upon the subjective plane, the image of the wizard
dominants of the collective unconscious represented me.</p>

<p>All this is covered in the dream by the symbol of the
crab which walks backwards. The crab stands for the living
content of the unconscious that can by no means be exhausted
or rendered inoperative by analysis on the objective plane.
But what we were able to do was to <em>detach the mythological or
collective psychological contents from the objects of consciousness,
and to consolidate them as psychological realities outside the
individual psyche</em>.</p>

<p>So long as the absolute unconscious and the individual
psyche are coupled together without differentiation, no progress
can be made, or, as the dream expresses it, no boundary
be crossed. If the dreamer does nevertheless prepare to cross
the boundary, the unconscious that was hitherto unnoticed
becomes animated, seizing her and dragging her down. The
dream and its material characterize the absolute unconscious,
on the one side as a lower animal living hidden in the depths
of the water; and on the other side, as a dangerous disease
that can only be cured by a timely operation. To what
extent this characterization is appropriate has already been
seen. As was pointed out, the animal symbol specially
refers to what is <em>extra</em> human, that is super-personal; for
the contents of the absolute unconscious are not merely the
residue of archaic human functions, but also the residue
of functions of the animal ancestry of mankind, whose duration
of life was indeed vastly greater than the relatively brief
epoch of specifically human existence. If such residues are
active, they are apt, as nothing else is, not merely to arrest the
progress of development, but also to divert the libido into
regressive channels, until the quantity which the absolute unconscious
has activated has been absorbed. The energy
becomes profitable again after it has been consciously contrasted
with the absolute unconscious, a process which enables
it to be converted into a valuable source from which to draw.
This transference of energy was established by religions in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
concretistic manner through cultural communication with the
gods (the dominants of the absolute unconscious). But these
modes and customs are too much at variance with our intellect
and our moral sense for us to be able to declare this solution of
the problem as still binding, or even possible. If, on the other
hand, we apprehend the images of the unconscious as collective
unconscious dominants, therefore as collective-psychological
phenomena or functions, this hypothesis is in no way
opposed to our intellect and conscience. This solution is
rationally acceptable. We have thus gained the possibility of
coming to terms with the activated residues of our ancestral
history. This mode of settlement makes it possible to traverse
the boundary line hitherto limiting us, and is therefore appropriately
termed the <em>transcendental function</em>, which is synonymous
with progressive development to a new attitude. In the
dream this development is indicated by the other side of the
stream.</p>

<p>The similarity to hero-myths is striking. The typical
combat of the hero with the monster (the unconscious content)
frequently takes place on the banks of some water; sometimes
at a ford. This circumstance is prominent in legends of Red
Indians, as, for example, in Longfellow's "Hiawatha." In the
decisive battle the hero is swallowed by a monster (<i>cf.</i> story
of Jonah), as Frobenius<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> has shown by means of extensive
material. But inside the monster the hero begins to come to
terms with the beast in his own way: whilst the creature
swims with him towards the sunrise, he cuts off a valuable
piece of the viscera, <i>e.g.</i> the heart, by which the monster
lived, that is, the valuable energy by which the unconscious
was activated. Through this deed he kills the monster, who
then drifts to land, where the hero, born anew through the
transcendental function (the "night-journey under the sea"
of Frobenius), steps forth, often in company with all those
beings whom the monster had previously swallowed. This
enables the normal state to be restored, as the unconscious
having been robbed of its energy no longer occupies a preponderating
position. In this way the myth&mdash;which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
dream of a people&mdash;graphically describes the problem with
which our patient is concerned.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>The problem of how to come to terms with the absolute
unconscious is a question apart. I must content myself here
with a general survey of the new theory of the unconscious up
to the transcendental function, leaving the presentation of the
transcendental function itself to a later work.</p>


<p class="p3">X.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Development of the Types of Introversion and
Extroversion in the Analytical Process.</span></p>

<p>The description of the analysis of the unconscious would
be incomplete if a word were not said about the question
whether this method is equally applicable to the two types.
As a matter of fact, both the development and the conception
of the unconscious are different for each type. Although
making every effort to find out a formulation that shall be
as universally valid as possible, we must emphatically impress
upon our minds the fact that the two modes of conception
of the types are essentially different; a universal
formulation that is just, only becomes possible when both
standpoints are given equal consideration. I do not conceal
from myself the fact that this subject is of less interest to the
layman than to the specialist. Nevertheless, certain aspects
of the question are of such a general character that the layman
should not find the perusal of this last section entirely
without interest.</p>

<p>Let us first consider the concept of the unconscious. I
have here introduced the unconscious under the conception of
a psychological function, namely, the function of the sum
of all those psychic contents which do not reach the threshold
of consciousness. I have divided the unconscious materials
into <em>personal</em>&mdash;that is to reminiscences attributable to personal
experiences, combinations and tendencies&mdash;and into <em>impersonal</em>
collective contents, that is, those whose contents cannot be
attributed to personal experiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>The contents of the psyche are fundamentally images
indicating function on the one hand, and upon the other
objects and the world generally. The conscious contains
the recent object-images; the personal unconscious, the
object-images of the individual past, so far as they have
either been forgotten or repressed; whilst the absolute or
collective unconscious contains the inherited world-images
generally, under the form of primordial images or mythical
themes. All psychic images have two sides: the one, being
directed towards the object, is as faithful a likeness of the
object as possible, framed without any intention or obligation
to be anything else. The other side is directed towards the
soul, that is towards the psychic function and the laws peculiar
to it.</p>

<p>Let us take as an example, a primordial image out of a hero-myth.
There is in the West a demon ancestress with a large
mouth. The hero creeps into it, and at the same moment
a certain little bird sings; the ancient dame shuts her mouth
with a bang, and the hero disappears.</p>

<p>The side of the image directed towards the physical object
means, the sun goes down in the evening into the mouth
of the ocean. At this hour a certain little bird sings (which is
an objective fact), and the sun disappears into the depths of
the sea.</p>

<p>The side of the image directed towards the soul, that is the
<em>idea</em>, signifies: The energy contained in consciousness disappears
(like the sun in the evening) into the monster of the
unconscious.</p>

<p>If we consider the collective-unconscious from the side
of the soul or idea, it is something entirely distinct, and it
must be differentiated, <em>abstracted</em> from the object, if its contents
are to attain the perfection of an idea. If, on the other
hand, we consider the collective-unconscious from the side of
the physical object, that is as an image of the object, it is
weaker and less clear than the object itself, and can only
be brought to perfection if it is objectified, that is projected on
to the object itself.</p>

<p>As previously explained, there are two types of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
psychology that can be clearly distinguished, viz. introversion
and extroversion. The introvert is characterised by the
thought standpoint; the extrovert by the feeling standpoint.
As I showed, they are quite different in their relation to the
object: the introvert abstracting from the object and thinking
about it, whilst the extrovert goes to the object and feels himself
into it. The accent of value lies upon the ego for the
introvert, but upon the object for the extrovert. The former's
chief concern is the preservation of the ego; that of the latter
the preservation of the object. The two types will adopt a
different attitude towards the unconscious, namely, the introvert
will and must seize the idea-side of the unconscious
image; the extrovert, on the other hand, seizing the side of
the physical reflection. The introvert will purify as far as
possible the idea-side from the "alloy" of the concretistic
admixture of the physical image, in order to arrive at the
abstract idea; whilst, on the other hand, the extrovert will
purify the physical image as far as possible from the "phantastic"
admixture of the enveloping ideas. The former, by
raising himself to a world of idea, will endeavour to overcome
the disturbing influence of the unconscious; whilst the latter
will approach the object as near as possible and project the
unconscious image into the physical object, thus freeing himself
from the grip of the unconscious.</p>

<p>What for the extrovert is a phantastic and disturbing admixture
in the unconscious picture, is for the introvert precisely
that which has the most value, for it is the germ of the
pure idea, and <em>vice versâ</em>; what for the introvert are merely
concretistical "imperfections," survivals of a physical origin,
are for the extrovert a most valuable hint, the bridge by
which the unconscious can be united with the object.</p>

<p>This description makes it manifest that the two types go
contrary ways in the course of the development of their unconscious,
arriving therefore at opposite extremes: the one at
the idea, the other at the object of his feeling. The psychological
characteristics of the types are eventually pushed to
extremes, where according to the enantiodromic law the
moment has arrived when in each case the "other" function<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
enters into its fully acknowledged right, that is, feeling in the
case of the introvert, and thought in that of the extrovert.
The introvert attains the lacking function of autonomous
feeling by means of a differentiation and enhancement of his
thought; whilst the extrovert, on the other hand, attains his
thinking by the way of an increasingly differentiated love.
These functions that hitherto were secondary are found at
first in the unconscious, gradually reaching consciousness
in the course of development. At first they are unconscious
functions in a state that is more or less incompatible
with consciousness and have the typical qualities of unconscious
contents. These qualities are such as are not tolerated
in consciousness. The lunatic Schreber<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> says most aptly
that the language of God (the unconscious) is a somewhat
archaic but vigorous German, of which he gives a few striking
examples. As the contrary function that emerges from the
unconscious into consciousness differs to such an extent from
what appears to be acceptable to consciousness, the necessity
arises of a technique for coming to terms with the contrary
function. It is impossible to accept the contrary function as
it stands, as it always drags extraneous qualities and accompanying
circumstances with it from the absolute unconscious.
Through the above-described development the extrovert has
acquired an adaptation to the object that is absolutely real
and free from all phantasies; he will therefore be able to
turn his attention towards the "alloy" which for the introvert
was the valuable germ of idea. From this he will then
develop similar ideas to those which the introvert has already
developed. <em>Vice versâ</em>, the introvert will now be able to
turn his attention to those materials which before he was
obliged to reject, as being side-tracks on the road to physical
reality; that is, he will carry out the same clearing and winnowing
in his feeling-relations, that the extrovert has already
completed.</p>

<p>The development of the contrary function that was hitherto
unconscious, leads to individuation beyond the type, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
thereby to a new relation to the world and mind. The process
which begins with the complementation of the types is the
transcendental function, which leads to the new adaptation
by means of the clearing and winnowing of unconscious feelings
and thoughts that have been brought up by the contrary
function that had been neglected.</p>

<p>Following the old maxim: "naturam si sequemur ducem
nunquam aberrabimus," we have obeyed the natural impulse
of the thinker to carry the principle of thought through to its
utmost perfection attainable, as also that of the feeler, of
carrying the principle of feeling through to the end. By these
means the salutary extreme was produced, to wit, the hunger,
the desire for the compensatory function. For, by means of
thought, the one is landed in a lifeless ice-cold world of
crystalline ideas; whereas, by means of feeling, the other
reaches a limitless ocean of never ending flood of sentiment.
The former will, therefore, yearn for living warmth of feeling,
and the latter for the restrictive precision and solidity of
thought.</p>

<p>An enrichment of the individual is attained by this compensatory
process, giving him greater decision and the possibility
of a harmony that is complete in itself. The
assimilation of the contrary function discloses new inner
springs, which guarantee to the individual considerably greater
independence from external conditions. This acquisition is
an indisputable advantage that none would like to surrender
in face of the fact so unavoidably connected with it, that a
new adaptation and orientation of this kind places the individual
in a certain contrast to the great bulk of people who
yet have the old attitude. This contrast is no drawback; it
is rather a welcome and effective spur to life and work, for
thereby is created the channel required by our psychic energy
for its development.</p>


<p class="p3">XI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">General Remarks on the Therapy.</span></p>

<p>I have still to draw the reader's attention to an important
fact. Throughout the course of this paper, I have seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
associate the idea of disturbance or even of peril with the
unconscious. But it would give a false impression if we
were only to emphasize the dangerous side of the unconscious.
<em>The unconscious is a source of danger when the individual is not
at one with it.</em> If we succeed in establishing the function or
attitude that I call transcendental, the disharmony ceases,
and we are permitted to enjoy the favourable side of the
unconscious. In such case the unconscious vouchsafes us
that furtherance and assistance which bountiful Nature is
always ready to give to man in overflowing abundance. The
unconscious possesses possibilities of wisdom that are completely
closed to consciousness, for the unconscious has at its
disposal not only all the psychic contents that are under the
threshold because they had been forgotten or overlooked, but
also the wisdom of the experience of untold ages, deposited in
the course of time and lying potential in the human brain.
The unconscious is continually active, creating combinations
of its materials; these serve to indicate the future path of the
individual. It creates prospective combinations just as our
consciousness does, only they are considerably superior to the
conscious combinations both in refinement and extent. The
unconscious may therefore be an unparalleled guide for human
beings.</p>

<p>The reader must on no account suppose that the complicated
psychological changes described must all be passed
through in every individual case. In practice the treatment
is adjusted according to the therapeutic result attained. The
particular result arrived at may be reached at any stage of
the treatment, quite apart from the seriousness or duration
of the malady. The treatment of a serious case may last a
long time, without the higher phases of the evolution ever
being reached, or needing to be reached. There are comparatively
few people who, after attaining the desired therapeutical
result, pursue the further stages of evolution for the
sake of their own development. It is, therefore, not the
seriousness of the case which obliges one to pass through
the whole development. In any case, only those people attain
a higher degree of differentiation who are by nature destined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
and called to it, that is, who have both a capacity and tendency
towards the higher differentiation. This is a matter in which
people are extremely different, just as among species of animals
there are some that are stationary and conservative, and
others that are evolutionary. Nature is aristocratic, but not
in the sense of having reserved the possibility of differentiation
exclusively for those species that stand high. Similarly,
the possibility of the psychological development of human
beings is not reserved for specially <em>gifted</em> individuals. In
other words: neither special intelligence nor any other talent
is necessary in order to achieve a far-reaching psychological
development, inasmuch as in this development moral qualities
step in to supplement where intellect does not suffice.
But it must not be supposed under any circumstances that
the treatment consists in grafting general formulas and complicated
doctrines on to people; this is not so. Each one can
acquire that which he needs, after his own fashion and in his
own language. What I have here presented is only the
intellectual formulation of the subject, founded upon preliminary
scientific study of an empirical as well as a theoretical
nature; but this formulation does not become a subject
of discussion in the ordinary practical analytical work. The
brief notes of cases that I have inserted give an approximate
idea of the practical side of analysis.</p>

<p>The reader should realize that our new understanding of
psychology has a side that is entirely practical, and another
that is entirely theoretical. It is not merely a practical
method of treatment or education, but it is also a scientific
theory, that is closely related to other co-ordinated sciences.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></p>

<p>In conclusion, I must beg the reader to pardon me for
having ventured to say so many new and abstruse things in
such a brief compass. I lay myself open to adverse criticism,
because I conceive it to be the duty of every one who isolates
himself by taking his own path, to tell others what he has
found or discovered, whether it be a refreshing spring for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
thirsty, or a sandy desert of sterile error. The one helps, the
other warns. Not the opinion of any individual contemporary
will decide the truth and error of what has been discovered,
but rather future generations and destiny. There are things
that are not yet true to-day, perhaps we are not yet permitted
to recognize them as true, although they may be true to-morrow.
Therefore every pioneer must take his own path,
alone but hopeful, with the open eyes of one who is conscious
of its solitude and of the perils of its dim precipices. Our age
is seeking a new spring of life. I found one and drank of it
and the water tasted good. That is all that I can or want to
say. My intention and my duty to society is fulfilled when I
have described, as well as I can, the way that led me to the
spring; the reproaches of those who do not follow this way
have never troubled me, nor ever will. New ideas always
encounter resistance from the old. That always was and
always will be the case; it appertains to the self-regulation
of mental progress.</p>

<p class="p3">THE CONCEPTION OF THE UNCONSCIOUS<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>


<p class="p3">I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Distinction between the Personal and the
Impersonal Unconscious</span></p>

<p>Since the breach with the Viennese school upon the question
of the fundamental explanatory principle of analysis&mdash;that is,
the question if it be sexuality or energy&mdash;our concepts have
undergone considerable development. After the prejudice
concerning the explanatory basis had been removed by the
acceptance of a purely abstract view of it, the nature of which
was not anticipated, interest was directed to the concept of
the unconscious.</p>

<p>According to Freud's theory the contents of the unconscious
are limited to infantile wish-tendencies, which are
repressed on account of the incompatibility of their character.
Repression is a process which begins in early childhood under
the moral influence of environment; it continues throughout
life. These repressions are done away with by means of
analysis, and the repressed wishes are made conscious. That
should theoretically empty the unconscious, and, so to say, do
away with it; but in reality the production of infantile sexual
wish-fantasies continues into old age.</p>

<p>According to this theory, the unconscious contains only
those parts of the personality which might just as well be
conscious, and have really only been repressed by the processes
of civilisation. According to Freud the essential content
of the unconscious would therefore be <em>personal</em>. But although,
from such a view-point the infantile tendencies of the unconscious
are the more prominent, it would be a mistake to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
estimate or define the unconscious from this alone, for it has
another side.</p>

<p>Not only must the repressed materials be included in the
periphery of the unconscious, but also all the psychic material
that does not reach the threshold of consciousness. It is
impossible to explain all these materials by the principle of
repression, for in that case by the removal of the repression a
phenomenal memory would be acquired, one that never forgets
anything. As a matter of fact repression exists, but it is a
special phenomenon. If a so-called bad memory were only
the consequence of repression, then those persons who have
an excellent memory should have no repression, that is, be
incapable of being neurotic. But experience teaches us that
this is not the case. There are, undoubtedly, cases with
abnormally bad memories, where it is clear that the main
cause must be attributed to repression. But such cases are
comparatively rare.</p>

<p>We therefore emphatically say that the unconscious contains
all that part of the psyche that is found under the
threshold, including subliminal sense-perceptions, in addition
to the repressed material. We also know&mdash;not only on account
of accumulated experience, but also for theoretical reasons&mdash;that
the unconscious must contain all the material that has
<em>not yet</em> reached the level of consciousness. These are the
germs of future conscious contents. We have also every
reason to suppose that the unconscious is far from being
quiescent, in the sense that it is inactive, but that it is probably
constantly busied with the formation and re-formation
of so-called unconscious phantasies. Only in pathological cases
should this activity be thought of as comparatively autonomous,
for normally it is co-ordinated with consciousness.</p>

<p>It may be assumed that all these contents are of a personal
nature in so far as they are acquisitions of the individual
life. As this life is limited, the number of acquisitions of the
unconscious must also be limited, wherefore an exhaustion of
the contents of the unconscious through analysis might be
held to be possible. In other words, by the analysis of the
unconscious the inventory of unconscious contents might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
completed, possibly in the sense that the unconscious cannot
produce anything besides what is already known and accepted
in the conscious. Also, as has already been said, we should
have to accept the fact that the unconscious activity had
thereby been paralysed, and that by the removal of the repression
we could stop the conscious contents from descending
into the unconscious. Experience teaches us that is only
possible to a very limited extent. We urge our patients to
retain their hold upon repressed contents that have been
brought to consciousness, and to insert them in their scheme
of life. But, as we may daily convince ourselves, this procedure
seems to make no impression upon the unconscious,
inasmuch as it goes on producing apparently the same
phantasies, namely, the so-called infantile-sexual ones, which
according to the earlier theory were based upon personal
repressions. If in such cases analysis be systematically
continued, an inventory of incompatible wish-phantasies is
gradually revealed, whose combinations amaze us. In addition
to all the sexual perversions every conceivable kind of
crime is discovered, as well as every conceivable heroic action
and great thought, whose existence in the analysed person no
one would have suspected.</p>

<p>In order to give an example of this, I would like to refer
to Maeder's Schizophrenic patient who called the world his
picture-book. He was a locksmith's apprentice who fell ill
very early in life; he had never been blessed with intellectual
gifts. As regards his idea that the world was his
picture-book and that he was turning its pages over when he
looked about in the world, it is just Schopenhauer's world,
conceived as will and representation, expressed in primitive
picture-language. This idea has just as universal a character
as Schopenhauer's. The difference consists in the fact that
the patient's notion has stood still at an embryonic stage in a
process of growth, whereas with Schopenhauer the same idea
has been changed from a mere image into an abstraction
expressed in terms that are universally valid.</p>

<p>It would be false to assume that the patient's idea had a
personal character and value. That would be to attribute to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
him the dignity of a philosopher. But he alone is a philosopher
who raises an image that has naturally sprung up into
an abstract idea, thereby translating it into terms of universal
validity. Schopenhauer's philosophical conception is his personal
value, whereas the notion of the patient has merely an
impersonal value of natural growth, in which personal proprietary
rights can only be acquired by making an abstraction
of the images, and translating them into terms that are
universally valid. But it would be wrong if an exaggerated
sense of the value of this achievement led us to ascribe to the
philosopher the merit of having made or conceived the original
image itself. The primordial image has also sprung up
naturally in the philosopher, and is nothing but a part of the
universal human heritage in which, theoretically at least,
every one has a share. The golden apples come from the
same tree whether they are gathered by a locksmith's
apprentice or a Schopenhauer.</p>

<p>The recognition of such primordial images obliges me to
differentiate between the contents of the unconscious; a
differentiation of another kind than that between the pre-conscious
and unconscious, or between the subconscious and
unconscious. The justification for those distinctions cannot be
discussed here; they have a value of their own and probably
merit to be carried further as affording a point of view. The
differentiation which I propose follows obviously from what
has previously been said, namely, that in the so-called unconscious
we must differentiate a layer which may be termed
the <em>personal unconscious</em>. The materials contained in this
layer are of a personal kind, inasmuch as on the one hand
they may be characterised as acquisitions of the individual
existence, and on the other as psychological factors which
might just as well be conscious. It is, for instance, comprehensible
that incompatible psychological elements succumb
to repression on the one hand and are therefore unconscious,
but on the other hand there exists the possibility of bringing
the repressed contents into consciousness and keeping them
there, once they are known and recognised. We recognise
these materials as personal contents, because we can prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
their effects, their partial appearance, or their origin to lie in
our personal past. They are integral constituents of the personality,
and belong to a complete inventory of the same.
They are constituents whose omission in consciousness implies
an inferiority in one respect or another, not indeed an inferiority
bearing the psychological character of an organic
deformity or a natural defect, but rather the character of a
neglect which arouses a moral reaction. The feeling of moral
inferiority always indicates that in the portion omitted is
something that according to the feelings should not be missing;
or in other words, could be conscious if we took sufficient
trouble about it. The sense of moral inferiority is not the
result of a collision with the universal, in a certain sense
arbitrary, moral law, but rather the result of a conflict with
the personal ego, which by reason of the psychic economy
demands an adjustment of the deficiency. Wherever a feeling
of inferiority appears, it reveals not only the presence of a
demand for the assimilation of an unconscious constituent,
but also the possibility of such an assimilation. It is, after
all, a person's moral qualities that make him assimilate his
unconscious self and retain it in consciousness, whether he be
forced to it by a recognition of its necessity, or by a painful
neurosis. He who continues to tread this path of the realisation
of his unconscious self, necessarily transposes the content
of the personal unconscious into consciousness, whereby the
periphery of the personality is considerably enlarged.</p>


<p class="p3">II&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Consequences of the Assimilation of the
Unconscious.</span></p>

<p>This process of assimilating the unconscious leads to
remarkable results. Some people build up from it an
unmistakable, even unpleasantly increased self-consciousness
or self-confidence; they "know everything," and are completely
aware of everything so far as their unconscious is
concerned. They think themselves accurately informed about
everything that comes up from the unconscious. Others are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
increasingly oppressed by the contents of the unconscious,
they lose their self-reliance or their self-consciousness more
and more, and come near to a state of depressed resignation
in regard to all the extraordinary things the unconscious produces.
The former undertake in the exuberance of their self-confidence,
a responsibility for their unconscious that goes
much too far, beyond every reasonable possibility; the latter
ultimately decline to accept any responsibility in the depressing
recognition of the powerlessness of the ego confronted by
relentless Destiny, working through the unconscious.</p>

<p>If we give the two types close analytical consideration, we
shall discover that behind the optimistic self-confidence of the
former there is hidden a just as deep, or rather a far deeper,
helplessness; a helplessness to which the conscious optimism
acts as an unsuccessful effort at compensation. Behind the
pessimistic resignation of the latter there is hidden a defiant
desire for power, far exceeding in self-confidence the conscious
optimism of the former type.</p>

<p>This condition of the personality may well be expressed by
the idea of "God-Almightiness" (Gottähnlichkeit),<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> to which
<cite>Adler</cite> has particularly drawn our attention.</p>

<p>When the devil wrote the serpent's words in the student's
album, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Eritis sicut Deus scientes bonum et malum</i>, he added:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Follow the ancient text and the snake thou wast ordered to trample!</div>
  <div class="i0">With all thy likeness to God, thou'lt yet be a sorry example."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The idea of "likeness to God," or "God-Almightiness," is
not a scientific one, although it characterises the psychological
state of affairs most exactly. Still we must examine whence
this attitude comes, and ask why it merits the name of "God-Almightiness."
As the expression denotes, the patient's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
abnormal condition is constituted by the fact that he ascribes
to himself qualities or values which obviously do not belong to
him, for "God-Almightiness" means being like the spirit
which is set above the human spirit.</p>

<p>If for psychological purposes we abstract from the hypostasis
of the God-idea, we find that this expression does not
only include every dynamic fact discussed in my book on
"The Psychology of the Unconscious,"<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> but also a certain
mental function having a collective character, which is of
another order from that of the individual character of the
mind. In the same way as the individual is not only an
isolated and separate, but also a social being, so also the
human mind is not only something isolated and absolutely
individual, but also a collective function. And just as certain
social functions or impulses are, so to speak, opposed to the
ego-centric interests of the individual, so also the human
mind has certain functions or tendencies which, on account
of their collective nature, are to some extent opposed to the
personal mental functions. This is due to the fact that every
human being is born with a highly differentiated brain, which
gives him the possibility of attaining a rich mental function
that he has neither acquired ontogenetically nor developed.
In proportion as human brains are similarly differentiated,
the corresponding mental functions are collective and universal.
This circumstance explains the fact that the unconscious
of far-separated peoples and races possesses a remarkable
number of points of agreement. One example among many
others which has been demonstrated is the extraordinary
unanimity shown by the autochthonous forms and themes
of myths.</p>

<p>The universal similarity of brains results in a universal
possibility of a similar mental function. This function is the
collective psyche, which is divided into <em>collective mind</em> and
<em>collective soul</em>.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> In so far as there exist differentiations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
corresponding to race, descent, or even family, so, beyond the
level of the "universal" collective psyche, we find a collective
psyche limited by race, descent, and family. To quote <cite>P.
Janet</cite>, the collective psyche contains the "parties inférieures"
of the mental function, that is, the part of the mental function
which, being fixed and automatic in its action, inherited and
present everywhere, is therefore super-personal or impersonal.
The conscious and the personal unconscious contain as personal
differentiations the "parties supérieures" of the mental
function, therefore the part that has been acquired and developed
ontogenetically.</p>

<p>An individual therefore who joins the <em>a priori</em> and unconsciously-given
collective psyche on to his ontogenetically
acquired assets, enlarges thereby the periphery of his personality
in an unjustifiable way, with the corresponding consequences.
Inasmuch as the collective psyche is the "partie
inférieure" of the mental function, and therefore is the fundamental
structure underlying every personality, it weighs
heavily upon and depreciates the personality; a fact that is
expressed in the afore-mentioned stifling of self-confidence,
and in the unconscious increase of the ego-emphasis up to the
point of a morbid will to power. Inasmuch as the collective
psyche ranks even above the personality, because it is the
mother foundation upon which all personal differentiations
are based, and because it is the common mental function of
the sum total of the individual, therefore its incorporation
in the personality may evoke inflation of self-confidence, an
inflation which is then compensated by an extraordinary
sense of inferiority in the unconscious.</p>

<p><em>A dissolution of the pairs of opposites in the personality sets
in</em> if, through the assimilation of the unconscious, the collective
psyche be included in the inventory of the personal
mental functions. Alongside the pairs of opposites already
alluded to that are so particularly evident in the neurotic,
viz. megalomania and sense of inferiority, there are also many
other pairs, of which I will only mention the specifically
moral pair, that is, good and evil (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">scientes bonum et malum</i>).
They accompany the increase or depreciation of self-confidence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
The specific virtues and vices of humanity are contained
in the collective psyche, just as everything else is.
One man ascribes all the collective virtue to himself as his
own personal merit; another accounts as personal guilt what
is but collective vice. Both are just as illusionary as the sense
of greatness and of inferiority, for imaginary virtues as well as
imaginary vices are only the pairs of moral opposites contained
in the collective psyche, which have become perceptible
or have artificially been made conscious. How far the collective
psyche contains these pairs of opposites is shown by
primitive peoples, whose great virtue is praised by one
observer; whereas another observer of the same race reports
only the worst impressions. Both views are true of primitive
man, whose personal differentiation is only beginning; his
mental function is essentially collective. He is more or less
identified with the collective psyche, and therefore without
any personal responsibility or inner conflict; his virtues and
vices are collective. Conflict only begins when a conscious
personal development of the mind has already started, whereby
the reason becomes aware of the irreconcilable nature of the
pairs of opposites. The struggle to repress is the consequence
of this realisation. Man wants to be good, therefore the bad
must be repressed; this puts an end to the paradise of the
collective psyche.</p>

<p>The repression of the collective psyche, in so far as it was
conscious, was a necessity for the development of the personality,
because collective psychology and personal psychology
are in a certain sense irreconcilable. In the history of
thought, whenever a fresh psychological attitude acquires
collective value the formation of schisms begins. Nowhere is
this more clearly seen than in the history of religion. A
collective point of view, although it may be necessary, is
always dangerous for the individual. It is dangerous because
it is apt to choke and smother personal differentiation. It
has derived this capacity from the collective psyche, which
is itself a result of psychological differentiation of the strong
gregarious instincts of humanity. Collective thought and
feeling, and collective accomplishment, are relatively easy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
comparison with individual function and performance; a fact
that is only too prone to lead to a fining down to the collective
level, and is peculiarly disastrous to personal development.
The concomitant loss of personality is replaced&mdash;as is always
the case in psychology&mdash;by an unconscious all-compelling
binding to and identification with the collective psyche. It
cannot be denied, and should be warningly emphasized that
in the analysis of the unconscious, the collective psychology is
merged into the personal psychology, with the afore-mentioned
unpleasant consequences. These consequences are either bad
for the individual's vital feeling (Lebensgefühl), or they injure
his fellow-beings if he have any power over his environment.
Being identified with the collective psyche he will inevitably
try to force the claims of his unconscious upon others, for
identification with the collective psyche is accompanied by
a feeling of universal validity ("God-Almightiness"), which
disregards the different psychology of his fellows.</p>

<p>The worst abuses of this kind may be removed by a clear
understanding and appreciation of the fact that there are
totally different psychological types, and that a psychology of
one type cannot be forced into the mould of another. It is
indeed almost impossible for one type to understand the other
completely, and a perfect comprehension of another's individuality
is impossible. <em>Due regard for another's individuality</em>
is not only advisable but is absolutely essential in analysis,
if the development of the other's personality is not to be
stifled. It should not be forgotten that the one type thinks
that he is leaving another person free when he grants him
freedom of action, and the other type when he grants him
freedom of thought. In analysis both must be conceded, in
so far as reasons of self-preservation permit the analyst to
accord them. An excessive desire to understand or explain things
is just as useless and injurious as a lack of comprehension.</p>

<p>The collective natural propensities and primary forms of
idea and feeling which analysis of the unconscious has shown
to be effective are an acquisition for the conscious personality
which cannot be admitted unreservedly without prejudicial
results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>In practical treatment<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> it is therefore of the utmost importance
to keep the aim of individual development constantly
before us. If for instance the collective psyche be conceived
as a personal possession or as a personal burden, an unbearable
weight or strain is put upon the personality. Hence we
must make a clear distinction between the personal and the
collective psyche. In practice this distinction is not easy
because the personal grows out of the collective psyche, and
is most closely joined with it. It is therefore difficult to say
which materials are to be termed collective and which personal.
There is no doubt, for instance, that the archaic
symbols so often found in phantasies and dreams are collective
factors. All primary propensities and forms of thought and
feeling are collective; so is everything about which men are
universally agreed, or which is universally understood, said
or done. Upon close consideration it is astonishing to note
how much of our so-called individual psychology is really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
collective; so much that the individual element quite disappears.
Individuation, however, is an indispensable psychological
requirement. The crushing predominance of what
is collective should make us realise what peculiar care and
attention must be given to the delicate plant "individuality,"
if it is to develop.</p>

<p>Human beings have a capacity which is of the utmost use
for purposes of collectivism and most prejudicial to individuation,
and that is the capacity to <em>imitate</em>. Collective psychology
cannot dispense with imitation, without which the organization
of the State and Society would be impossible. Imitation includes
the idea of suggestibility, suggestive effect, and mental
infection.</p>

<p>But we see daily how the mechanism of imitation is used,
or rather abused, for the purposes of personal differentiation;
some prominent personality, or peculiar trait or activity is
simply imitated, which at least brings about an external
differentiation from the environment. As a rule this delusive
attempt to attain individual differentiation by means of imitation
comes to a standstill as mere affectation, the individual
remaining on the same plane as before, only a few degrees
more sterile than formerly, and under an unconscious compulsory
bondage to his environment.</p>

<p>In order to find out what is really individual in us, we
should have to give the matter deep thought, and we should
certainly become aware how exceedingly difficult such a discovery
is.</p>


<p class="p3">III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Individual as an Excerpt of the Collective
Psyche.</span></p>

<p>We now come to a problem the overlooking of which
would cause the greatest confusion.</p>

<p>As I said before, the immediate result of the analysis of
the unconscious is that additional personal portions of the
unconscious are incorporated into the conscious. I called
those parts of the unconscious which are repressed but
capable of being made conscious, <em>the personal unconscious</em>. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
showed moreover that through the annexation of the deeper
layers of the unconscious, which I called the <em>impersonal unconscious</em>,
an extension of the personality is brought about
which leads to the state of God-Almightiness ("Gottähnlichkeit").
This state is reached by a continuation of the
analytical work, by means of which we have already re-introduced
what is repressed to consciousness. By continuing
analysis further we incorporate some distinctly impersonal
universal basic qualities of humanity with the personal consciousness,
which brings about the aforesaid enlargement, and
this to some extent may be described as an unpleasant consequence
of analysis.</p>

<p>From this standpoint, the conscious personality seems to
be a more or less arbitrary excerpt of the collective psyche.
It appears to consist of a number of universal basic human
qualities of which it is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i> unconscious, and further of a
series of impulses and forms which might just as well have
been conscious, but were more or less arbitrarily repressed,
in order to attain that excerpt of the collective psyche, which
we call personality. The term <em>persona</em> is really an excellent
one, for persona was originally the mask which an actor wore,
that served to indicate the character in which he appeared.
For if we really venture to undertake to decide what psychic
material must be accounted personal and what impersonal, we
shall soon reach a state of great perplexity; for, in truth, we
must make the same assertion regarding the contents of the
personality as we have already made with respect to the impersonal
unconscious, that is to say that it is <em>collective</em>, whereas
we can only concede <em>individuality to the bounds of the persona</em>,
that is to the particular choice of personal elements, and that
only to a very limited extent. It is only by virtue of the fact
that the persona is a more or less accidental or arbitrary
excerpt of the collective psyche that we can lapse into the
error of deeming it to be <em>in toto</em> individual, whereas as its
name denotes, it is only a mask of the collective psyche;
<em>a mask which simulates individuality</em>, making others and oneself
believe that one is individual, whilst one is only acting a
part through which the collective psyche speaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>If we analyse the persona we remove the mask and discover
that what appeared to be individual is at bottom collective.
We thus trace "the Little God of the World" back to his
origin, that is, to a personification of the collective psyche.
Finally, to our astonishment, we realise that the persona was
only the mask of the collective psyche. Whether we follow
Freud and reduce the primary impulse to sexuality, or Adler
and reduce it to the elementary desire for power, or reduce it
to the general principle of the collective psyche which contains
the principles of both Freud and Adler, we arrive at the same
result; namely, the dissolution of the personal into the collective.
Therefore in every analysis that is continued sufficiently
far, the moment arrives when the aforesaid God-Almightiness
must be realised. This condition is often ushered in by
peculiar symptoms; for instance, by dreams of flying through
space like a comet, of being either the earth, the sun, or a
star, or of being either extraordinarily big or small, of having
died, etc. Physical sensations also occur, such as sensations
of being too large for one's skin, or too fat; or hypnagogic
feelings of endless sinking or rising occur, of enlargement of
the body or of dizziness. This state is characterised psychologically
by an extraordinary loss of orientation about one's
personality, about what one really is, or else the individual
has a positive but mistaken idea of that which he has just
become. Intolerance, dogmatism, self-conceit, self-depreciation,
contempt and belittling of "not analysed" fellow-beings,
and also of their opinions and activities, all very frequently
occur. An increased disposition to physical disorders may
also occasionally be observed, but this occurs only if pleasure
be taken therein, thus prolonging this stage unduly.</p>

<p>The wealth of the possibilities of the collective psyche is
both confusing and dazzling. The dissolution of the persona
results in the release of phantasy, which apparently is nothing
else but the functioning of the collective psyche. This release
brings materials into consciousness of whose existence we had
no suspicion before. A rich mine of mythological thought
and feeling is revealed. It is very hard to hold one's own
against such an overwhelming impression. That is why this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
phase must be reckoned one of the real dangers of analysis,
a fact that should not be concealed.</p>

<p>As may easily be understood, this condition is hardly
bearable, and one would like to put an end to it as soon as
possible, for the analogy with a mental derangement is too
close. The essence of the most frequent form of derangement&mdash;dementia
præcox or schizophrenia&mdash;consists, as is well
known, in the fact that the unconscious to a large extent
ejects and replaces the conscious. The unconscious is given
the value of reality, being substituted for the reality function.
The unconscious thoughts become audible as voices, or visible
as visions, or perceptible as physical hallucinations, or they
become fixed ideas of a kind that supersede reality. In a
similar, although not in the same way, by the resolution of
the persona of the collective psyche, the unconscious is drawn
into the conscious. The difference between this state of mind
and that of mental derangement consists in the fact that the
unconscious is brought up by the help of the conscious
analysis; at least that is the case in the beginning of analysis,
when there are still strong cultural resistances against the
unconscious to be overcome. Later on, after the removal of
the barriers erected by time and custom, the unconscious
usually proceeds, so to say, in a peremptory manner, sometimes
even discharging itself in torrents into the consciousness.
In this phase the analogy with mental derangement is
very close. But it would only be a real mental disorder
should the content of the unconscious <em>take the place of the
conscious reality</em>, that is, in other words, if the contents of the
unconscious were believed absolutely and without reserve.</p>


<p class="p3">IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Endeavours to free the Individuality from the
Collective Psyche.</span></p>

<p class="center">1. <em>The Regressive Restoration of the Persona.</em></p>

<p>The unbearableness of thus being identified with the collective
psyche forces us to find a radical solution. There are
two ways open. The first possibility is the regressive one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
trying to restore the persona to its former condition, by
endeavouring to restrain the unconscious by the application
of a reductive theory; for instance, by declaring it to be
nothing but long-repressed and overdue infantile sexuality,
for which it would really be best to substitute the normal
sexual function. This solution is based upon the unmistakable
sexualistic symbolism of the language of the unconscious,
and upon the concretistic interpretation of the same. Or an
attempt may be made to apply the power theory, by conceiving
the God-Almightiness as a "virile protest," and as an
infantile striving for power and self-preservation: a theory
for which support is found in the unmistakable pretensions
to power that the unconscious material contains. A further
possibility would be to declare the unconscious to be the
archaic collective psychology of primitive man, an explanation
that would not only cover the sexualistic symbolism and the
"God-Almighty" aiming for power of the unconscious content,
but would also apparently do justice to the religious,
philosophical, and mythological aspects and tendencies of the
unconscious content. In every case the conclusion arrived at
is the same, viz. that the unconscious is nothing but this or
that, which has already been adequately recognised and acknowledged
as infantile, useless, meaningless, impossible, and
out of date. There is nothing to be done but to shrug one's
shoulders and resign one's self to the inevitable.</p>

<p>To the patient there seems to be no alternative, if one
wishes to continue to live sensibly, but to restore in so far as
is possible that extract of the collective psyche termed persona,
to lay the fact of analysis silently aside, and do one's utmost
to forget that one possesses an unconscious. We shall find
support in Faust's words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The sphere of earth is known enough to me;</div>
  <div class="i0">The view beyond is barred immutably:</div>
  <div class="i0">A fool, who there his blinking eyes directeth,</div>
  <div class="i0">And o'er his clouds of peers a place expecteth!</div>
  <div class="i0">Firm let him stand, and look around him well!</div>
  <div class="i0">This world means something to the capable.</div>

  <div class="i0">Thus let him wander down his earthly day;</div>
  <div class="i0">When spirits haunt go quietly his way;</div>
  <div class="i0">In marching onward, bliss and torment find,</div>
  <div class="i0">Though every moment, with unsated mind!"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This would be a happy solution if one really could succeed
in throwing off the unconscious to such an extent as to withdraw
the libido from it, and so render it inoperative. But
experience proves that energy cannot be withdrawn from the
unconscious; it continues operative, for the unconscious contains
and is indeed itself the source of libido, from which issue
the primary psychic elements, thought-feelings, or feeling-thoughts&mdash;undifferentiated
germs of idea and sentiment. It
would therefore be a delusion to believe that by means of
some, so to say, magical theory or method, the libido could
be conclusively wrested from the unconscious, or that it could
be to a certain extent disconnected. One may yield to this
illusion for a time, but some day he will be obliged to declare
with Faust:&mdash;</p>

<p>The unconscious cannot be "analysed" to a finish, and
thus brought to a standstill. No one can wrest active force
from it for any length of time. Therefore to act according to
the method just described is only to deceive one's self, and is
nothing but a new edition of an ordinary repression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">2. <em>The Identification with the Collective Psyche.</em></p>

<p>The second way would be that of identification with the
collective psyche. That would mean the symptom of "God-Almightiness"
developed into a system; in other words, one
would be the fortunate possessor of the absolute truth, that
had yet to be discovered; of the conclusive knowledge, which
would be the people's salvation. This attitude is not necessarily
megalomania ("Grössenwahn") in a direct form, but
the well-known milder form of having a prophetic mission.
Weak minds which, as is so often the case, have correspondingly
an undue share of vanity and misplaced naïveté at their
disposal, run a considerable risk of succumbing to this temptation.
The obtaining access to the collective psyche signifies a
renewal of life for the individual, whether this renewal of life
be felt as something pleasant or unpleasant. It would seem
desirable to retain a hold upon this renewal: for one person,
because it increases his feeling for life ("Lebensgefühl"); for
another, because it promises a great accretion to his knowledge.
Therefore both of them, not wishing to deprive themselves
of the rich values that lie buried in the collective
psyche, will endeavour by every means possible to retain their
newly gained union with the primal cause of life. Identification
appears to be the nearest way to it, for the merging of
the persona in the collective psyche is a veritable lure to unite
one's self with this "ocean of divinity," and, oblivious of the
past, to become absorbed in it. This piece of mysticism
belongs to every finer individual, just as the "yearning for
the mother"&mdash;the looking back to the source whence one
originated&mdash;is innate in every one.</p>

<p>As I have demonstrated explicitly before,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> there is a special
value and a special necessity hidden in the regressive longing&mdash;which,
as is well-known, Freud conceives as "infantile
fixation" or as "incest-wish." This necessity and longing is
particularly emphasized in myths, where it is always the
strongest and best of people, in other words, the hero, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
follows the regressive longing and deliberately runs into danger
of letting himself be devoured by the monster of the maternal
first cause. But he is a hero only because, instead of letting
himself be finally devoured by the monster, he conquers it,
and that not only once but several times. It is only through
the conquest of the collective psyche that its true value can
be attained, whether it be under the symbol of capture of
treasure, of an invincible weapon, of a magical means of
defence, or whatever else the myth devises as the most desirable
possession. Hence whoever identifies himself with the
collective psyche, also reaches the treasure which the dragon
guards, but against his will and to his own great injury, by
thus allowing himself (mythologically speaking) to be devoured
by the monster and merged with it.</p>

<p>Identification with the collective psyche is therefore a
failure; this way ends just as disastrously as did the first,
which led to the severance of the persona from the collective
psyche.</p>


<p class="p3">V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Leading Principles for the Treatment of Collective
Identity.</span></p>

<p>In order to solve the problem how practical treatment can
overcome the assimilation of the collective psyche, we must
first of all make quite clear to ourselves what was the error of
the two ways already described. We saw that neither the one
way nor the other led to any appropriate result. The first
way simply leads the patient back to the point of departure,
having lost the vital values contained in the collective psyche.
The second way leads him straight into the collective psyche,
having lost that detached human existence which alone
renders possible a bearable and satisfying life. There are on
both sides values that should not be lost to the individual.</p>

<p>The mistake is, therefore, neither in the collective psyche
nor in the individual psyche, <em>but in allowing the one to exclude
the other</em>. The monistic tendency assists this propensity, for
it always suspects and looks for <em>one</em> principle everywhere. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
a general psychological tendency, monism is a peculiarity of
differentiated feeling and thought, corresponding to the keen
desire to make the one or the other function the supreme
psychological principle. The introversion type only knows
the thought principle, and the extroversion type only that
of feeling. This psychological monism&mdash;or it would be better
to say monotheism&mdash;has the advantage of simplicity, and the
disadvantage of one-sidedness. On the one hand, it signifies
the exclusion of the variety and true riches of life; whilst
on the other, it means the practicability of realizing the
ideals of the present day and of the near past. But it does
not in itself signify any actual possibility of human progress.</p>

<p>In the same way <em>rationalism</em> tends towards exclusiveness.
Its essence is to exclude instantly whatever is opposed to its
standpoint, whether it be intellectually logical or emotionally
so. In regard to reason it is both monistic and autocratic.
Special thanks are due to Bergson for having broken a lance
for the right of the irrational to exist. Psychology will probably
be obliged to acknowledge and to submit to a plurality
of principles, in spite of the fact that this does not suit the
scientific mind. Only so can psychology be saved from ship-wreck.</p>

<p>But with regard to individual psychology science must
waive its claims. For to speak of a scientific individual
psychology is in itself a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">contradictio in adjecto</i>. It is
necessarily always only the collective part of an individual
psychology that can be the subject of scientific study, for the
individual is&mdash;according to definition&mdash;something unique and
incomparable. A "scientific" individual psychology is a
denial of individual psychology. It may justly be suspected
that individual psychology is indeed a projection of the
psychology of him who defines it. Every individual psychology
must have its own text-book, for the universal text-book only
contains collective psychology.</p>

<p>These remarks are intended to prepare for what has to
be said about the treatment of the aforesaid problem. The
fundamental error of both the afore-mentioned ways is simply
that the subject is collectively identified with the one or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
other part of his psychology. His psychology is individual
as well as collective, but not in such a manner as to merge
the individual with what is collective, or the collective with
what is individual. The persona must be strictly separated
from the concept of the individual, in so far as the persona
can be absolutely merged with the collective. But what is
individual is just that which can never be absorbed in the
collective, and is, too, never identical with the collective.
Therefore, an identification with the collective or an arbitrary
cutting-off from the collective is equivalent to illness; it is
pathological.</p>

<p>As has already been indicated, what is individual appears
at first as the particular selection of those elements of the
collective psyche that contribute to the composition of the
persona. As I said before, the components are not individual
but collective. It is only their combination, or the selection
as a model of particular groups that had already been combined,
which is individual. That would be the individual
nucleus which is concealed by the personal mask. By the
particular differentiation of the persona, the resistance is
shown of the individuality to the collective psyche. By analysing
the persona, we transfer a greater value to the individuality,
increasing thereby its conflict with collectivity.
This conflict obviously is a psychological conflict in the
individual. The dissolution of the compromise between the
two halves of a pair of opposites increases the effectiveness
of the contrast. This conflict does not exist within the sphere
of purely unconscious natural life, although the purely physiological
life of the individual also has to comply with collective
demands.</p>

<p>The natural unconscious attitude is harmonious; the body,
with its capacities and needs, providing immediately indications
and limitations, that prevent intemperance and lack of
proportion. A differentiated psychological function, however,
always inclines towards disproportion, on account of the one-sidedness
which is cultivated by the conscious rationality of
intention. What is called mental individuality, is, also, an
expression of the individual corporeity, being, so to speak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
identical with it. This sentence might obviously also be
reversed, a fact that does not materially alter the real psychological
data concerning the intimate relation of the individuality
to the body. At the same time, the body is also
that which makes the subject resemble all others to a great
extent, although it is the individual body that is differentiated
from all others.</p>

<p>Similarly the mental or moral individuality differs from
all others, although in every respect it is so constituted as to
place one person on an equality with all others. Every living
creature that is able freely to develop itself individually without
any coercion at all, will, through the perfecting of its
individuality, soonest realize the ideal type of its species, and
therefore, figuratively speaking, will have collective validity.</p>

<p>The persona is always identical with a <em>typical</em> attitude, in
which <em>one</em> pyschological function dominates, <i>e.g.</i> feeling, or
thought, or intuition. This one-sidedness always causes the
relative repression of the other functions. In consequence of
this circumstance, the persona is hindering to the development
of the individual. The dissolution of the persona is, therefore,
an indispensable condition of individuation. It is, therefore,
to some extent impossible to achieve individuation by means
of conscious intention; for conscious intention leads to a conscious
attitude, which excludes everything that "does not suit."
But the assimilation of the unconscious contents leads, on
the contrary, to a condition in which conscious intention is
excluded, being replaced by a process of development that
appears to us irrational. This process alone signifies individuation,
its <em>product</em> being individuality as defined above,
viz. as something individual that is at the same time universal.
So long as the persona exists individuality is repressed,
betraying itself at most by the particular selection of personal
requisites, of what might be called the actor's costumes. Only
when the unconscious is assimilated does the individuality
become more prominent, and with it also that uniting psychological
phenomenon between the ego and non-ego, expressed
by the word <em>attitude</em>, is now no longer a typical attitude
but an individual one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>What is paradoxical in these formulations arises from the
same cause from which the conflict about the "universalia"
formerly arose. The phrase "animal nullumque animal
genus est" makes the fundamental paradox clearly comprehensible.
What exists "really" is individual: that which is
universal is existing psychologically, but being caused by the
real-existing similarities of individual things. The individual
is, therefore, the individual thing that has, to a greater or less
extent, those attributes upon which the collective conception
of "collectivity" rests; and the more individual he is, the
more he develops those attributes that are the basis of a
collective concept of human nature.</p>

<p>If a grotesque figure, suggested by the initial situation of
our problem be permitted, it is Buridan's ass between the
two bundles of hay. His questioning is obviously wrong:
the question is not whether the hay-bundle on the right or the
left be the better one, or whether he should begin to eat on
the right or the left hand, <em>but what he himself would like to do,
what he is eager for</em>&mdash;that is the point. He is thinking of the
hay and not of himself, and therefore he does not know what
he really wants.</p>

<p>The question is: what at this moment is the natural
direction of the growth of this individual?</p>

<p>This question cannot be settled by any philosophy, religion
or good advice, but solely by an unprejudiced review of the
psychological germs of life which have resulted from the
natural co-operation of the conscious and unconscious on
the one hand, and of the individual and the collective on
the other. One person looks for them in the conscious, and
another in the unconscious. But the conscious is only one
side, and the unconscious is only the other. For it should
never be forgotten that dreams are compensatory or complementary
to consciousness. Were this not the case, we should
be obliged to regard dreams as a source of knowledge superior
to the conscious. This view would undoubtedly carry us back
to the mentality of the augur, and we should have to accept all
the consequences of such a superstitious attitude, unless, indeed,
we look upon dreams as valueless, as does the vulgar mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>We find the <em>unifying function</em> that we are seeking, <em>in the
phantasies</em> in which everything that has any effectual determination
is present. But phantasies have a bad reputation
among psychologists. The psychoanalytical theories hitherto
obtaining have treated them accordingly. For both Freud
and Adler the phantasy is nothing but a so-called "symbolic"
disguise of what both investigators suppose to be the primary
propensities and aims. But in opposition to these views it
should be emphasised&mdash;not for theoretical but for essentially
practical reasons&mdash;that the phantasy may indeed be thus
causally explained and depreciated, but that it nevertheless
is the creative soil for everything that has ever brought
development to humanity. The phantasy as a psychological
function has a peculiar non-reducible value of its own, whose
roots are in both the conscious and the unconscious contents,
and in what is collective as well as in what is individual.</p>

<p>But whence comes the bad reputation of the phantasy?
It owes that reputation chiefly to the circumstance that it
ought not to be taken literally. It is worthless if understood
concretistically. If we understand semiotically, as Freud does,
it is interesting from the scientific standpoint. But if it be
understood <em>hermeneutically, as an actual symbol</em>, it provides
us with the cue that we need in order to develop our life in
harmony with ourselves.</p>

<p>For the significance of a symbol is not that it is a disguised
indication of something that is generally known,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> but
that it is an endeavour to elucidate by analogy what is as yet
completely unknown and only in process of formation.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The
phantasy represents to us that which is just developing under
the form of a more or less apposite analogy. By analytical
reduction to something universally known, we destroy the
actual value of the symbol; but it is appropriate to its value
and meaning to give it an hermeneutical interpretation.</p>

<p>The essence of hermeneutics&mdash;an art that was formerly
much practised&mdash;consists in adding more analogies to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
already given by the symbol: in the first place, subjective
analogies given by the patient as they occur to him; and in
the second place, objective analogies provided by the analyst
out of his general knowledge. The initial symbol is much
enlarged and enriched by this procedure, the result being a
highly complex and many-sided picture, which may now be
reduced to <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tertia comparationis</i>. Thence result certain psychological
lines of development of an individual as well as collective
nature. No science upon earth could prove the accuracy
of these lines; on the contrary, rationalism could very easily
prove that they are wrong. But these lines vindicate their
validity by their <em>value for life</em>. The chief thing in practical
treatment is that people should get a hold of their own life,
not that the principle of their life should be provable or
"right."</p>

<p>Of course, true to the spirit of scientific superstition <em>suggestion</em>
will be mooted. But it should long ago have been realised
that a suggestion is only accepted by one it suits. Beyond
that there is no suggestion, otherwise the treatment of neurosis
would be extremely simple, for we should only need to suggest
health. This pseudo-scientific talk about suggestion is based
upon the unconscious superstition that suggestion actually
possesses some real magic power. No one succumbs to suggestion
unless from the very bottom of his heart he be willing
to co-operate.</p>

<p>By means of the hermeneutical treatment of the phantasies
we arrive at the synthesis of the individual with the collective
psyche, put theoretically, that is, but practically, one indispensable
condition is yet lacking. For it belongs to the regressive
disposition of the neurotic&mdash;a disposition in which he has been
confirmed in the course of his illness&mdash;to take neither himself
nor the world seriously, but always to rely on this or that
method or circumstance to effect a cure, quite apart from his
own serious co-operation. "But you can't wash the dog without
getting his skin wet." No cure can be effected without
unlimited willingness and absolute seriousness on the part of
the patient. There are no magical cures for neurosis. Just
as soon as we begin to elaborate the symbolic outlines of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
path, the patient must begin to walk thereon. If he delude
himself and shirk it, no cure can result. He must really
work and live according to what he has seen and recognised as
the direction for the time being of his individual life-line, and
must continue thereon until a distinct reaction of his unconscious
shows him that he is beginning in good faith to go a
wrong way.</p>

<p>He who does not possess this moral function of faithfulness
to himself will never get rid of his neurosis; but he who
has this faithfulness can find the way out.</p>

<p>Neither physician nor patient must yield to the delusion
that "being analysed" is in itself sufficient to remove a
neurosis. That would be deception and self-delusion. Ultimately
it is infallibly the moral factor that decides between
health and illness.</p>

<p>By the construction of the individual's life-line the ever-varying
trends and tendencies of his libido are made conscious.
These life-lines are not identical with the "directing fictions"
discovered by Adler, which are none other than arbitrary
attempts to cut the persona off from the collective psyche,
and to give it independence. It might rather be said that
the "directing fiction" is an unsuccessful attempt to construct
a life-line. The unsuitability of the "directing fiction"
is also proved by the fact that the lines are tenaciously
retained for much too long a time. The hermeneutically constructed
life-line is short, for life follows no straight lines
that indicate the future long beforehand, for, as Nietzsche
says, "All truth is crooked." Life-lines are therefore neither
principles nor ideals of universal validity, but points of view
and adaptations of ephemeral validity. An abatement of
vital intensity, a perceptible loss of libido, or an excessive
passion or ecstasy&mdash;all show that one such line is left, and
that a new line begins, or rather should begin. Sometimes it
is enough to leave the revealing of the new line to the unconscious;
but this course should indeed not be recommended to
the neurotic under all circumstances, though there are cases
where what is needed is to learn to trust to so-called chance.
However, it is not advisable to let one's self drift for any length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
of time; a watchful eye should at least be kept upon the
reactions of the unconscious, that is to say, upon the dreams:
these indicate like a barometer the one-sidedness of our
attitude.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Therefore, I consider it necessary, in contrast to
some other analysts, for the patient after analysis to remain
in contact with the unconscious, if he would avoid a relapse.
That is why I am convinced that the real end of analysis is
reached when the patient has acquired adequate knowledge of
the method to remain in contact with the unconscious, and
sufficient psychological knowledge to be able to understand
approximately his ever-changing life-line; otherwise he is not
in a position to follow the direction of the libido currents in
the unconscious, and thereby to gain conscious support in
the development of his individuality. Every serious case of
neurosis needs this weapon in order to maintain the cure.</p>

<p>In this sense analysis is not a method that is a medical
monopoly, but rather an art or technique or science of psychological
life, which he who has been cured must continue
to foster, for the sake of his own welfare and that of his
environment. If he understands this aright he will not pose
as a psychoanalytical prophet nor as a public reformer, but
truly understanding the common weal, he will first himself
reap the benefit of the self-knowledge acquired in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
treatment, and then he will let the example of his life work
what good it can, rather than indulge in aggressive talk and
missionary propaganda.</p>



<h3><a name="Summary" id="Summary"><span class="smcap">Summary.</span></a></h3>

<p class="p7">A. <em>Psychological Material must be divided into</em> <span class="smcap">Conscious</span>
<em>and</em> <span class="smcap">Unconscious</span> <em>Contents</em>.</p>

<p>1. The <em>conscious contents</em> are partly <em>personal</em>, in so far as
their universal validity is not recognised; and partly <em>impersonal</em>,
that is, collective, in so far as their universal validity
is recognised.</p>

<p>2. The <em>unconscious contents</em> are partly <em>personal</em>, in so far
as they concern solely repressed materials of a personal
nature, that have once been relatively conscious and whose
universal validity is therefore not recognised when they are
made conscious; partly <em>impersonal</em>, in so far as the materials
concerned are recognised as <em>impersonal</em> and of purely universal
validity, of whose earlier even relative consciousness we have
no means of proof.</p>


<p class="p7">B. <em>The Composition of the Persona.</em></p>

<p>1. The conscious personal contents constitute the conscious
personality, the conscious ego.</p>

<p>2. The unconscious personal contents constitute the <em>self</em>,
the unconscious or subconscious ego.</p>

<p>3. The conscious and unconscious contents of a personal
nature constitute the persona.</p>


<p class="p7">C. <em>The Composition of the Collective Psyche.</em></p>

<p>1. The conscious and unconscious contents of an <em>impersonal</em>
or collective nature compose the psychological <em>non-ego</em>, the
<em>image of the object</em>. These materials can appear analytically
as projections of feeling or of opinion, but they are <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
collectively identical with the object-imago, that is they appear
as qualities of the object, and are only <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a posteriori</i> recognised
as subjective psychological qualities.</p>

<p>2. The persona is that grouping of conscious and unconscious
contents which is opposed as ego to the non-ego. The
general comparison of personal contents of different individuals
establishes their far-reaching similarity, extending
even to identity, by which the <em>individual</em> nature of personal
contents, and therewith of the persona, is for the most part
suspended. To this extent the persona must be considered
an excerpt of the collective psyche, and also a component of
the collective psyche.</p>

<p>3. The collective psyche is therefore composed of the
object-imago and the persona.</p>


<p class="p7">D. <em>What is Individual.</em></p>

<p>1. What is individual appears partly as the principle that
decides the selection and limitation of the contents that are
accepted as personal.</p>

<p>2. What is individual is the principle by which an increasing
differentiation from the collective psyche is made
possible and enforced.</p>

<p>3. What is individual manifests itself partly as an impediment
to collective accomplishment, and as a resistance
against collective thinking and feeling.</p>

<p>4. What is individual is the uniqueness of the combination
of universal (collective) psychological elements.</p>


<p class="p7">E. <em>We must divide the Conscious and Unconscious Contents
into Individualistic and Collectivistic.</em></p>

<p>1. A content is individualistic whose developing tendency
is directed towards the differentiation from the collective.</p>

<p>2. A content is collectivistic whose developing tendency
aims at universal validity.</p>

<p>3. There are insufficient criteria by which to designate a
given content as simply individual or collective, for uniqueness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
is very difficult to prove, although it is a perpetually and universally
recurrent phenomenon.</p>

<p>4. The life-line of an individual is the resultant of the
individualistic and collectivistic tendency of the psychological
process at any given moment.</p>

still, but are constantly subjected to fine tremors. Preyer, Lehmann, and
others have proved that these movements are influenced in a high degree by
the predominant presentations. Preyer shows that the outstretched hand
drew small, more or less faithful, copies of figures which were vividly presented.
These purposeful tremors can be demonstrated in a very simple way
by experiments with the pendulum.</p></div>

to reject the idea of being merely incarnation, merely mouthpiece, merely
the medium of superior forces. The concept revelation in the sense that
quite suddenly, with ineffable certainty and delicacy, something is seen,
something is heard, something convulsing and breaking into one's inmost
self, does but describe the fact. You hear&mdash;you do not seek; you accept&mdash;asking
not who is the giver. Like lightning, flashes the thought, compelling
without hesitation as to form&mdash;I have had no choice" (Nietzsche's "Works,"

moment. But when we look back along our life's path and fix our eyes
chiefly upon our unfortunate steps and their consequences, often we cannot
understand how we came to do this and leave that undone, and it seems as
if some power outside ourselves had directed our steps. Shakespeare says;</p>

French savant assured us that the Freudian theory was but "une plaisanterie."
This gentleman has demonstrably neither read Freud's latest works
nor mine, he knows less about the subject than a little child. This opinion,
so admirably grounded, ended with the applause of a well-known German
professor. One can but bow before such thoroughness. At the same Congress
another well-known German neurologist immortalised his name with the
following intellectual reasoning: "If hysteria on Freud's conception does
indeed rest on repressed affects, then the whole German army must be
hysterical."</p></div>

libido. Libido can perhaps be described as "effect," or "capacity for effect."
It is capable of transformation from one form to another. The metamorphosis
can be sudden, as when one function replaces another in a moment of danger;
or it can be gradual, as we see it in the process of sublimation, where the libido
is led over a long and difficult path through a variety of forms into a different
function."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mary Moltzer.</span></p></div>

before analysis, not only in the neurotic, but also in the normal individual,
with the difference only that the normal individual is effectively separated

impossible to the neurotic. In consequence of his special sensitiveness,
the neurotic is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> more closely affected by the processes of the unconscious

<p><a name="Footnote_253_253" id="Footnote_253_253"></a><a href="#FNanchor_253_253"><span class="label">[253]</span></a> I should here observe that I am intentionally refraining from discussing
our problem from the standpoint of the psychology of types. A specialised
and somewhat complicated investigation was necessary in order to discover
formulations appropriate to the types. For instance, "person" means something
totally different to the extrovert from what it does to the introvert.
I must content myself here with pointing out the difficulties such a task
would involve. In the types, the conscious and real adapted function in
childhood is collective, but soon acquires a personal character, and may
retain this to the end, unless the individual feels impelled to develop his
type to the uttermost. If this happens, the conscious real adapted function
attains a degree of perfection which may claim universal validity and therefore
bears a collectivistic character, in contrast to its originally collective
character. According to this mode of expression collective psyche would be
identical with "herd soul" in the individual; but the collectivistic psychology
would be a highly differentiated adaptation to society. For the introvert the
conscious real adapted function is <em>thinking</em>, which in the lower stages of
development is entirely personal, but has a tendency to acquire a universal
character of a collectivistic kind; his feeling remains distinctly personal so
far as it is conscious, and collective-archaic in so far as it has remained
unconscious or is repressed. The opposite applies to the <em>feeling</em> and thought
of the extrovert. The introvert is always concerned with the endeavour to
preserve the integrity of his ego, which results in a different attitude towards
his own person from that of the extrovert, whose adaptation is made through
his feelings, even at the cost of his own person. These few sentences indicate
into what an extraordinarily difficult situation we should have been led had
we considered our problem from the standpoint of the types.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_257_257" id="Footnote_257_257"></a><a href="#FNanchor_257_257"><span class="label">[257]</span></a> It should be borne in mind that no moral function is to be sought in
this conception of dreams, nor do I look for it there. This function is just as
little "teleological" in the sense of a philosophical teleology, that is to say of
a set aim or purpose. It is in the first place compensatory, because it presents
a subliminal picture of the actual situation. The phenomenon should first
of all be understood from a purely causal standpoint. But it would be unjust
to the essence of what is psychological if one were to consider it purely
causally. For it does not only tolerate, but also demand, a final point of view.
In other words, the question arises, what is the use of bringing just this
material to constellation? This is not to assert that the final meaning of a
phenomenon had already existed as an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> given purpose in the preparatory
stages of the phenomenon. It would not be permissible, according to the
theory of cognition, to presuppose some pre-existing purpose from the unmistakable
final meaning of biological mechanisms. But it would be narrow-minded
if, with the justifiable omission of the teleological conclusion, one
wished also to give up the point of view of finality. The utmost that can be
said is, it is <em>as if</em> there were some pre-existing purpose present. In psychology
one must be on one's guard against exclusive reliance either upon
causality or upon teleology.</p></div>
